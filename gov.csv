Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Lieutenant Governor Ainsworth, Pro Tempore Marsh, Speaker McCutcheon, Speaker Pro Tempore Gaston, members of the Alabama Legislature, Chief Justice Parker, justices of the Alabama Supreme Court, distinguished guests – and my fellow Alabamians:"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Just over 48 hours ago, Mother Nature’s wrath – in the form of vicious and deadly tornados – ripped through our state, leaving behind significant devastation."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,At least 23 innocent lives were lost.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Young children who had barely experienced life.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Mothers. Fathers. Friends and neighbors.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"It is during times like these that we turn to the good Lord, asking for His continued comfort and healing hands."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,We also give special thanks for the emergency responders and local law enforcement.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Please join me as we observe a moment of silence to remember all those who passed away, as well as many others who were injured."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"While there is always uncertainty in what tomorrow may bring, there is absolute certainty in the resiliency of the people of Alabama."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"After all, we’ve done it before, and we will do it again."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"This is a time for all of Alabama – and our entire nation – to rally behind these good people. Together, we will bring Lee County back to its feet!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In our 200 years of statehood, the men and women of Alabama have always stepped forward when our nation called."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"When our country needed defending, the legendary Tuskegee Airmen were born."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"When our country was plagued with injustice, it was an Alabama woman that refused to give her seat up on a bus."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"When our country sought to do the impossible and take man to the moon, it was Alabamians that built the rocket that successfully launched and returned them home."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"The people of our state shaped the past. They are influencing the present, and without a doubt, they are at the forefront of defining our future."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Since this occasion last year, our story in Alabama has continued to evolve with one major accomplishment after another. At the same time, we are managing to fund state government, remaining conservative with the hard-earned dollars the men and women of this state send to us."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, I am proud to report that the state of our state is growing stronger each day. Our state’s recent history combined with the willing attitude I sense in the Chamber this evening, will aid in our quest to overcome our long-neglected issues and will help us achieve even greater prosperity for the entire state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"We will accomplish this together, because we are Alabama, and this is our time."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Alabama’s economy is breaking records some thought we would never see.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In 2018, alone, Alabama achieved a historic total of $8.8 billion dollars in new capital investments, which created more than 17,000 new and future jobs for our people!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Major technology companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Shipt are showing the rest of the country what it means to do business in our state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Alabama is on track to be the number two auto-producing state in the nation, in less than five years. This is remarkable for a state that 25 years ago did not produce a single car, truck or SUV."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Our aerospace industry is, once again, redefining the futures of both our state and nation. With the recent groundbreaking for Airbus’s second assembly line, the City of Mobile is positioned to be one of the top four cities in the world for aerospace manufacturing. And up in Huntsville, construction began on Blue Origin’s $200 million-dollar rocket production facility, further solidifying Alabama’s critical role in putting the United States at the forefront of space exploration."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Now, just as Alabama has emerged as a powerhouse in the automotive and aerospace industries, our Department of Commerce, under the direction of Secretary Greg Canfield, is working hard to expand project activity in areas like technology, forestry and bioscience."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Members of the Legislature, companies from around the globe want to be part of the gold standard that is known by the “Made in Alabama” brand."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,And make no mistake. The upward trend in Alabama’s economy is a direct compliment to the men and women in Alabama’s workforce. These very men and women are regaining hope because of the good-paying jobs that are pouring into our state.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"The Department of Labor, under the capable leadership of Secretary Fitzgerald Washington, is working hard to ensure we fulfill our vision of connecting every Alabamian who wants a job with a job."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, Alabama has seen a record-breaking year!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Last year, we recorded the lowest unemployment rate in our history: 3.7 percent. That’s a record for our state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In December 2018, Alabama reported having the most people working in our state’s history. That means 49,000 more Alabamians are working today than were a year ago. That’s a record for our state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"When economists predicted we would gain 27,000 jobs in 2018, in natural Alabama fashion, we exceeded that projection by supporting more than 44,000 additional jobs! That, too, is a record for our state!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Even so, there are still some 80,000 Alabamians seeking employment opportunities. And to those across our state who are still searching, I urge you to not lose faith, because we are not going to rest on our efforts, and we will not leave you behind."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Regardless of their own individual situation, every Alabamian must be given an opportunity to provide for themselves and their family, enabling them to climb the ladder to success."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"For us to better provide for all of our citizens, it is vitally important that Alabama has maximum participation in the upcoming 2020 Census. We will be launching the Alabama Counts campaign next month, with the goal simply being to secure much-needed federal funds for our state. At the same time, we are ensuring that our representation in Congress remains unchanged, guaranteeing Alabamians a strong voice for the next decade."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As you would expect, the hardworking men and women of Alabama will always come first in the Ivey Administration."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Under Republican leadership, over the past few years, the people of Alabama have experienced major gains. We have seen significant growth in our economy. We have cut taxes on middle-class families, and we are shrinking government."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Sometimes people forget that during the past few years, we have repealed more than 300 obsolete laws and regulations. And since 2010, we have reduced the number of state employees by more than 6,000 people. That means we are operating leaner, smarter and stronger."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"And because of the approach taken by Republican leadership since 2010, Alabama has saved literally hundreds of millions of dollars!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As we know, every dollar spent by the government belongs to the hardworking men and women of our state. Last year, I was very proud to sign into law the largest tax break for middle-class Alabamians in more than a decade! In turn, the total impact is projected to net $40 million dollars in savings for our taxpayers over the next decade. All of our efforts are centered on doing what is best and right for the people of our state – and that begins with protecting their hard-earned dollars whenever and however we can."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Doing what is best and right for our people also means giving every Alabamian the opportunity for a quality education. Through ‘Strong Start, Strong Finish’, we are making important strides to improve Alabama’s education system."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"For a child to reach their fullest potential later in life, they must first build a strong educational foundation. Under the nationally-recognized leadership of Secretary Jeana Ross, the tremendous efforts of the Department of Early Childhood Education have enabled Alabama’s First Class Pre-K to be ranked as the nation’s highest quality program for the 12th consecutive year!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Most importantly, our efforts are giving more of Alabama’s children a strong start."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Last year, we increased funding by $18.5 million dollars, which was the largest, single-year increase ever approved. And because of that historic investment, 107 new First Class Pre-K classrooms were added last fall, which led Alabama to officially break the 1,000-classroom mark."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Additionally, our P-3 pilot program aimed at building upon the gains made in Pre-K, grew by 75 classrooms this school year."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As we anticipate the rising demand of the computer science field, we are continuing our efforts to enhance computer science education in Alabama."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Last year, I signed legislation establishing the Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering. We also secured additional funding to create the Alabama Math and Science Teacher Education Program, which provides a better pathway to certify future computer science teachers."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Today in Alabama, women and minorities make up well over half of the population. Yet, they are underrepresented in the STEM professions."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Tonight, I am pleased to have with us a young woman who is the face of changing this disparity, specifically in the area of computer science. Arrington Harper is currently a senior at the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In her ninth-grade year, she had her very first computer science class."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Since then, Arrington has excelled. She is a recipient of the Aspirations in Computer Science Award for Alabama. She is an advocate for computer science education and girls in computer science. She wants to use her passion to help address the gender and race gaps that exist in computer science education. Arrington has spoken to numerous groups of parents and educators and was invited by the National Center for Women in IT to share her experiences at large. She plans to major in computer science in college."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Arrington represents my vision for education in our state. It was in a classroom where she discovered her niche, and through the guidance of her dedicated teachers and her own hard work, this young lady is headed into a very promising future. Arrington, could you please stand to be recognized?"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Equipping our students with the proper skills and education to fill high-demand jobs is essential to ensure their strong finish.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Part of my mission for the state, is to carve a path for our students to enter the workforce, highly-skilled and well-equipped. To further our efforts, I am asking the Legislature to fund our new co-op program for Alabama’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"It is geared specifically toward Alabama’s HBCU students interested in pursuing careers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. It is not only a win for these students; it’s a win for these colleges and universities. And it’s a win for our employers who are gaining qualified individuals to strengthen the work of their company."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Each year, uses for the internet grow more dynamic. Delivering high speed broadband access is absolutely necessary. Last year, through the Alabama Broadband Accessibility Act, we connected broadband in seven counties."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"One notable example is in Choctaw County. Within the next two years, more than 700 residences and businesses will have access to high-speed internet service."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Thanks to this grant program, living in rural Alabama does not mean being cut out! This is a major step forward for education, for economic prosperity and for the entire state of Alabama!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In our efforts to meet the current and future needs of business and industry, I have established the Governor’s Office of Education and Workforce Transformation. The focus will be solely on aligning our workforce development funding streams to create the most effective workforce development programs for Alabamians across the state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Since we met last year, we have been ambitious in our efforts to improve Alabama’s education system and are now on our way to providing all our students a quality education."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Each of us has our own story to tell.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"My own story began in the public schools of rural Wilcox County, Alabama."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"I graduated from high school in a class that had 35 students. My surroundings at Auburn University would look a whole lot different, though. Instead of a class of 35, I would be one in a college of more than 12,000. My Wilcox County upbringing would be put side by side with some of the smartest young people from bigger schools in larger cities."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"However, I would not allow these challenges to hinder me from achieving success."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"So, in the summer before my first semester, I spent a week on campus to walk the grounds to know exactly where my classes would be located and try out for the Auburn University Marching Band."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Benjamin Franklin said it best, “If you fail to plan, you’re planning to fail.”"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,I worked hard and planned for success.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,My journey from Wilcox County also brought me to where I stand this evening.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Despite the heavy challenges that lie ahead, we in Alabama must plan for success."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Part of planning for that success is ensuring that we have a robust economy and ample public safety. We can help tackle both of these issues with a reasonable increase in the investment we make in our state’s infrastructure system.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Almost three decades have gone by, and Alabama has not made one change to our infrastructure funding."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"While our neighboring states are increasing their revenue for their transportation budgets, Alabama has not. We are dead last."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Certainly, motorists are experiencing firsthand the poor conditions of Alabama’s infrastructure."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Each year in Alabama, 69 billion miles are driven on our roadways."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,We have urban roads in poor condition. Our drivers are experiencing major congestion on our freeways.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"County governments currently operate on a 56-year resurfacing schedule; when, in fact, we should be operating on a 15-year rate."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"In Alabama, half of our more than 16,000 bridges are older than their 50-year life span."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Bridges should be replaced every 50 years. Yet, county governments are on schedule to replace their bridges every 186 years! Folks, that’s almost as long as Alabama has been a state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"From 2015 to 2017, Alabama saw nearly 3,000 traffic fatalities. One-third of those were due to deficiencies in our roadways."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Each year, $436 billion dollars in goods are shipped to and from businesses using our state’s roadways."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"The Port of Mobile, Alabama’s only deep-water port, moves approximately 64 million tons of cargo each year. Deepening and widening the Port will increase Alabama’s economic capability. This will enhance our status as a primary industrial and agricultural hub in the Southeast."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Driving on rough roads costs the average Alabamian $507 dollars annually in additional vehicle maintenance – a total of $2 billion dollars statewide, each year!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,That is why we are proposing a 10-cent increase in Alabama’s fuel tax. This increase would be implemented over the next three years.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,And I want to be crystal clear – this money will be scrutinized and watched over – every single penny. There will be strong accountability measures to make certain these monies are spent solely on transportation infrastructure. Period.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Leading the charge in the Legislature on this issue is Representative Bill Poole. He along with Senator Clyde Chambliss, will guide this legislation over the coming weeks. I thank both of them for their leadership."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Additionally, I have listened to leaders make good points about money being diverted from the Alabama Department of Transportation to supplement our court system and law enforcement agency every year."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"I believe we should begin to unwind this outdated approach. And, in fact, the budgets I am presenting will cut this annual transfer in half without hurting the court system or our hardworking state law enforcement officers."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"A renewed investment in infrastructure will lead to safer roads, economic prosperity and an enhanced quality of life."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am willing to call you, the members of the Alabama Legislature, into a special session, if necessary, to focus solely on passing this critical legislation."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Beginning tomorrow, as we enter this special session, we must shift our focus and tackle this issue together!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,It’s time to make our crumbling infrastructure system a problem of the past.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"This is a challenge that is felt by every Alabamian, clearly making it a bipartisan issue."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As governor, I say enough is enough."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,Now is the time to Rebuild Alabama.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Another problem that has gone unaddressed for years and years is that of the horrendous conditions of our prisons. Our next step, however, must be to address the issue of understaffing to improve our recruiting and retention efforts."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Alabama is currently under a federal court order requiring the state to roughly double the number of corrections officers over the next two years. If we fail to resolve the apparent issue of understaffing in our prisons, federal courts will dictate what needs to happen in our own state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,I am proposing we include an additional $31 million dollars in the General Fund budget. This will allow us to hire 500 new correctional officers and increase the pay scale for all prison security personnel to make their salary competitive. This is an Alabama problem that must have an Alabama solution.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As we move forward, we must continue to wisely use our funds. I am proud that the General Fund budget I am proposing will do just that."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As a positive sign of that progress, Medicaid, under the capable leadership of Commissioner Stephanie Azar, will require $40 million dollars less in 2020 than compared to 2019. The Medicaid program in Alabama is driving efficiency, while being prudent with our taxpayer dollars."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,I am also proposing an additional $7 million dollars to fund important Mental Health programs in our state.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"As governor, I will do everything in my power to make Alabama safer, which is why my General Fund budget includes funding to hire and train 50 additional State Troopers."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"I have also included in my budget a 2 percent pay raise for all state employees. These men and women went too long without merit raises, and with the increase last year and the additional increase this year, we are making it right."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Like my General Fund budget, my education budget is practical, while still helping more Alabamians receive the opportunity for a quality education."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,My education budget will provide $25 million dollars to expand our nationally-recognized First Class Pre-K program. This significant increase will expand the program by 193 classrooms. It will be the largest investment in Alabama First Class Pre-K to date and takes us even closer to providing more of Alabama’s youngest learners a strong start.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Alabama’s institutions of higher education are making major research contributions. They generate significant revenue for our state. They serve as a major part of our identity in Alabama. Most importantly, they are preparing hundreds of thousands of students to enter the workforce."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Because of their significant contributions to our state, my budget provides an increased investment of $75 million dollars to our four-year public colleges and universities. These institutions are essential to the future of our state."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Alabama’s teachers are vital to our students throughout every step of their learning journeys, and they deserve to be the highest paid public employees in our state. That is why, tonight, I am proposing to the Legislature a four percent raise for all teachers: pre-k through community college! Without our teachers, our students cannot achieve success!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,The foundation for a strong future for all Alabamians begins in the classroom.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Members, I remind you that our story in Alabama will go long past the time you and I are in office."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"When we make improvements to our state’s infrastructure, to our prisons, and to our education system, we are planting a seed of opportunity for Alabama’s next 200 years."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am a governor looking beyond the next four, the next eight or even 10 years."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,I am a governor leading our state into the next century.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"I am all in! And the people of our great state need you, legislators, all in as well."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"Democrats, republicans, progressives and conservatives."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"To achieve a better future in Alabama, all of us must be willing to build on our successes."
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,We must be willing to overcome our long-neglected issues.
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,"We must be willing to take the next step, because we are Alabama, and this is our time!"
Alabama,Kay Ivey,Republican,May God continue to bless each of you and the great state of Alabama!
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Thanks, everyone for your gracious welcome. I truly appreciate it. It’s been just seven weeks since I took the oath of office to become the twelfth Governor in the history of our young state."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’m here today because of the People of Alaska, who put their faith in me and in my vision, for our great state."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Too often leaders seem to forget a simple truth: Government gets all of its authority from the people.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,The Court system has no power – except what the people give.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,The Legislature has no power – except what the people give.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"The Governor has no power either– except what you, the people of Alaska, give."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"This evening, as I stand before the People of Alaska, delivering my first State of the State Address, I reflect on where we are as a state, the opportunity before us, and what this point in history means for Alaska."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Before I continue, I’d like to take a moment and introduce members of my administration. I would ask them to please stand. Thank you all very much."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"And now I’d like to introduce someone who is very special to me: my wife of 31 years, the First Lady Rose Dunleavy. Rose is from Northwest Alaska and we were married in the wonderful city of Nome. We have three independent, free-spirited, and very self-reliant daughters: Maggie, Catherine, and Ceil Ann, who love Alaska as much as we do."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Like many Alaskans, I enjoy the outdoors, hunting, fishing, and the boundless adventures and opportunities our great state has to offer. Yet, I’m a man who chose education as a career, because I love helping kids and I love learning and teaching."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’m not a career politician. I’ve only been in politics for eight short years — three of those years as a school board member, and five years as a state senator."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’ve always wanted to help people. This is why I went into politics. Last year, I followed my heart and my gut, and decided in order to change the course of our great state, that I would run for governor. And so, I did. And then I was elected."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"How did this retired teacher get elected governor? Was it my social graces and charm?  Not really. If you ask, me, I’d say the other candidates were much better connected in the social circles, better looking, and far more charming."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Was it my eloquent speeches or my debating skills?  Not really. If you ask me, I’d say all the other candidates were smoother and better debaters."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Was it because I was the tallest? Well, I do stand out in the crowd a bit, but I don’t think that was it either."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’m Governor today because of the campaign promises I made to the people of Alaska on the issues most of us believe in. I’m here to do exactly what I promised to do, what I told Alaskans I would do."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"So, here it is:"
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We’re going to declare war on criminals.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We’re going to get our spending in line with our revenue. This has to be done.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We’re going to protect Alaskans’ Permanent Fund dividends.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We’re going to grow our economy and put Alaskans to work.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,And we must restore public trust in government and elected officials.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"That’s what my plan was last year, and that’s my plan now."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"But before I could be sworn in, our world shook.  As we know, the second-most damaging earthquake in Alaska’s history struck Southcentral Alaska on November 30,, 2018, with over $100 million in damages."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Within hours of the quake, I was down at the State Emergency Operations Center, assessing the situation. I want to thank Governor Walker for working with my team during the process."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Last month I met with President Trump and had the opportunity to brief him on the earthquake damage and recovery efforts. The President confirmed his strong support. And the congressional delegation and I will work together to hold the federal government to its commitment.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,This is an example of Alaskans coming together to solve significant problems.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We all feel a deep sense of gratitude to the men and women who served as emergency responders. They are Alaska heroes. There were countless examples of Alaskans who made us proud:  Hospital employees were ready to treat the injured. School teachers kept kids safe and evacuated them from unsafe buildings. And contractors rushed to repair damage to roads and buildings in record time.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Neighbors helping neighbors. That’s what Alaska is all about.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"A perfect example of this are two middle schoolers we have with us today: Tor Petersen and Kayana Marquiss. For them, it started out like any other day.  And then it hit. When the quake struck and their school began to shake violently, they knew this was serious."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Relying on what Tor was taught by his amazing teachers, he immediately sought safety. But he soon realized one of his classmates needed help. Putting his own safety aside, Tor proceeded to do what heroes do. He took immediate action, grabbed ahold of Kayana and led her to the safest part of the room."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,I would ask Tor and Kayana to please stand and be recognized. You two exemplify what the spirit of Alaska is all about.  I want to thank you both for reminding us that in a time of crisis how good all of us can be to each other.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"That day, Alaskans demonstrated to the world our resiliency. Alaskans were at their finest."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"It was a perfect example that together we can overcome anything; that together we will make our streets safe again; that together we will build a permanent fiscal plan; that together, we will protect the Permanent Fund dividend for generations to come. That together, we will restore the trust of the Alaska People in their government and their elected officials."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I promised during the campaign to follow the law on the PFD. And that’s exactly what we should do. Alaskans’ PFDs should be paid in full using the law that has worked for decades, and the PFD should be protected in the Constitution, now and for the future."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Last week, I introduced two bills for the back-pay owed to Alaskans on their PFDs. I urge you to act swiftly on those bills. Every penny of that PFD money due Alaskans is sitting in the Earnings Reserve Account, and is available for distribution."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Let’s act now and put this issue behind us once and for all.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Now let’s talk about creating a real, honest budget."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Alaskans believe our state budget process is a mess. There is simply no other way to describe it.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Why is it a mess?
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Because our government spending far exceeds the revenue we take in. Kicking the can down the road for years, wiping out billions from savings, and then taxing the PFD, all the while just hoping for another oil boom — it simply doesn’t work."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"The days of creating a “wish list” budget, where Alaska is more like a reality show — make a wish, have your dream come true — that just isn’t real life."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"The days when anything and everything is just too important not to fund, and where politicians spend their time looking for ways for you to pay for it? Those days have got to be over. We can no longer spend what we don’t have."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"We are now preparing a budget that for the first time all Alaskans will be able to understand and trust. No more games, no more shuffling numbers. Just an honest, straightforward look at where we are."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"While no one person is to blame, Alaskans will quickly see that we’ve been spending wildly beyond our means for years. Our children and grandchildren deserve better."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"In order to get a handle on the budget, one of my first administrative orders was to centralize the budget-making functions of all departments under the Office of Management and Budget."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"My administration will be focused on the basic functions of government, while realigning programs and operations to eliminate duplication and prioritize each agency’s core mission."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"My first budget is going to be an honest budget. As I promised the people, we must start from the standpoint that expenditures must equal revenue. We can’t go on forever using savings to plug the budget gap."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"But that’s only part of the solution. In order to address the fiscal issues that have plagued our state for years, we need a permanent fiscal plan, a plan that will put our state on solid footing for decades to come."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"To be fair, this isn’t a new struggle for our state, we’ve struggled with this before. When Alaska first became flush with oil money from Prudhoe Bay, many were focused on spending as much as possible."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"However, there were some in the Legislature, even back then, who were concerned about where we were headed."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’d like to take a moment to introduce Dick Randolph from Fairbanks.  Dick is a former teacher, an insurance agent and a retired legislator, who in the 1970s and early 1980s had the foresight to understand that the People of Alaska, through constitutional amendments and the initative process, could help us control our spending and develop a sustainable fiscal plan."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Enlightened legislators, such as Representative Randolph, trusting the People of Alaska, put forth a number of constitutional amendments, including the Permanent Fund, to try to bring order to the spending mania."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Representative Randolph, please stand. I want to thank you for your foresight and wisdom, coupled with the belief that the people, individual Alaskans, through constitutional amendments, are the key to securing Alaska’s future. Thank you, Dick."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"And for those of us in the room today, we have an opportunity to work together and complete the process those enlightened legislators started many decades ago."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Therefore, next week I will introduce three constitutional amendments, which will be the foundation of a permanent fiscal plan."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"If we wish to win the People’s trust, we must trust the People. This fiscal plan is empowered by the People, for the People:"
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"First, a spending limit and savings plan that will keep politicians from spending every penny we have, one that allows us to save excess revenue when possible for future Alaskans."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Second, there should be no change to the PFD without a vote of the people."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,The third constitutional amendment will call for no change in taxes without a vote of the People.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"These three constitutional amendments will require that both the people of Alaska and their elected officials work closely together to secure our future. The People are the key to a permanent fiscal plan. Without the People’s support, any plan put in place by the Legislature will always be in doubt."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Another key component in securing Alaska’s future are investments and jobs. Politicians often talk about policies and laws, but what Alaskans really care about, are jobs, opportunities, and individual freedoms. With jobs come independence, self-reliance, self-respect, thriving communities, and hope for the future."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"There’s no doubt our economy is struggling. There’s no doubt when people don’t have opportunities, hope fades."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"While the rest of the country’s economy has been booming for years, Alaska remains mired in recession with the worst unemployment rate in the nation. Let that sink in for a moment."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,I will be a relentless advocate for turning this around. I’ve said that we’re going to make Alaska “open for business” – and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"We often talk about diversifying the economy. The irony is, years ago, some would say Alaska had more of a diversified economy than we do today. We had more Alaskans engaged in commercial fishing, mining, agriculture, and a once-robust timber industry."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"However, since Prudhoe Bay came online, we have become more narrowly focused on oil and government programs as the basis for our economy, while neglecting other opportunities that could create more jobs and wealth for our state."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"For Alaska to fully realize our potential, including our location on the globe, our vast resources, and unbridled quality of life, we must look to other industries and investments to come to Alaska."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"As a result, we have put together a team that will market Alaska to the world. It’s a team of experts with backgrounds in finance, marketing, and research that will inform investors, industries, and individuals that Alaska is open for business and we want new business here."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Our location on the globe is a distinct advantage.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,The third-busiest cargo hub in the world is also an advantage to doing business here in Alaska.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Our proximity to Asia and Europe is an advantage.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Our quality of life is a distinct advantage as well.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Alaska doesn’t have to be just a resource state. We have so much more to offer. It is my goal to be able to report to you in the near future about all of the new industries coming to Alaska, because of these efforts."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"For those who have little hope that Alaska can diversify its economy, we need only to look to two small Alaska companies that, through good old-fashioned capitalism and entrepreneurship, created thriving businesses right here in our state."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"One of these businesses, Triverus, is located in Palmer and owned by Hans Vogel."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"His company was awarded a contract by the Department of Defense for a machine that cleans the decks of the entire U.S. aircraft carrier fleet. These machines are designed, engineered, and manufactured right here in Alaska and shipped all over the world.  He does this with no tax credits or subsidies from the state."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,I repeat — no tax credits and no subsidies from the state government.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Another company thriving here in Alaska is Bambino’s Baby Food, owned by Zoi Maroudas. She noticed customers were not happy with the quality of baby food available — and Zoi responded. She started the company right here in Alaska and now employs 25 Alaskans.  By the end of this month, she plans to begin exporting to Asia."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,This is what I am talking about. This is the future of Alaska.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Zoi and Hans, you both demonstrate to us all that there are boundless opportunities for Alaska to diversify our economy. Zoi is in the gallery tonight and I would ask her to stand. Hans is unfortunately weathered out of Juneau this evening. I want to thank you both for the example you have set for Alaska."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"While all of these initiatives I’ve presented so far are critical to securing Alaska’s future, in the end, our primary responsibility and the most important thing a government can do is keep its citizens safe."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We all know crime is out of control. Everyone in this room has either been affected by crime or knows someone who has.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"And when it comes to sexual assault, Alaska stands alone.  Our sexual assault rate is the highest in the nation."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"To put this in perspective, New York City has a sexual assault rate of 28 incidences per 100,000 people. Compare this to Anchorage, which has 132 sexual assaults per 100,000 people.  That’s almost five times that of New York City. Let that sink in."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"This is an outrage. Plain and simple. The women and children of Alaska, must be made safe, and we have an obligation, all of us in this room, to do everything we possibly can to stop this scourge in Alaska. We can no longer stand by and allow this to be the reality that faces Alaskans every day."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"In addition to sexual assault, our murder rate is horrific. Tonight, I would like to recognize two Alaskan families who know firsthand the personal devastation that comes from violent crime.  Edie and Ben Grunwald from Palmer, who lost their son David; and Scotty and Aaliyah Barr from Kotzebue, who lost a daughter and a sister, Ashley. ­­­­­­­­"
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Unfortunately, we all know their tragic stories too well — two beautiful young Alaskans taken from their families by individuals who have no regard for human life."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Scotty and Aaliyeah Barr are here with us tonight, I would ask them to please stand. The Grundwald family was unfortunately unable to make it due to weather. Thank you having the strength to be here with us tonight."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Edie, Ben, Scotty, and Aaliyah, I speak for all of those here today, and every Alaskan: We are heartbroken and mourn with you over this senseless loss. Nobody should have to go through the devastation and pain you have endured.  But know this, the loss of Ashley and David has mobilized Alaska. Your loss is going to be the catalyst that will push us forward into a safer Alaska."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"And I say to you, and to everyone, today begins a new day in our state. From this day forward, we will not cater to the criminals and ignore the victims. We will not make excuses and turn a blind eye. I ask everyone in this room tonight – and across Alaska — to join in making Alaska the safest state in the country."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"There is a lot that government should not do, cannot do, or does not do well. But the most important thing a government must do is keep its people safe. History will judge those of us in this room tonight on how we respond to this crisis.  At what point do we say enough is enough?  I say that time is now."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"Therefore, we will expend the necessary resources for additional State Troopers, provide more local control, and more prosecutors. We will ensure that our courts will remain open five full days a week in order to hear cases. We will provide the focus and the resources necessary to combat the scourge of opiates and other illicit drugs driving up our crime rates and ruining lives."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"And we will repeal and replace SB 91.  A series of bills and initiatives to be introduced tomorrow will not only roll back SB91, but will help Alaska turn the corner to a safer tomorrow."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"To our legislators, I’m asking you to make public safety a priority and move forward with due diligence on reviewing and considering this public safety package."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"To law-abiding Alaskans, I say this to you: I care if your house is burglarized. I care if your car is stolen. And I care if your loved ones are threatened."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"But to the criminals, and to the rapists and molesters who see women and children as nothing more than opportunities, I say this to you: We will do everything in our power to stop you, apprehend you, and put you in prison for a very long time."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"For those Alaskans who have made a mistake and have gotten involved with opiates or other drugs and want help, we are a compassionate people as well. Therefore, as part of our public safety approach we will provide ways for you to break this habit and get back into society and be productive individuals."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"But let me be perfectly clear. If you are a criminal, this is going to be a very dangerous place for you, starting now. I strongly suggest you get out while you can. No more coddling, no more excuses.  Your days are over."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’m going to go to great lengths to make sure we are safer, and you will see that reflected in my budget."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"With SB 91, we broke the People’s trust and now is the time to restore it. By doing the right things, we can fix what is broken and restore the trust that was lost."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I’m here to serve the People of Alaska. I’m here to work with you, the Legislature. I’m here because, like all of you, I believe in this great state. I’m here tonight because Alaskans want to chart a different course.  I’ve made promises that I intend to keep."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"We’re all part of the greatest experiment in self-government in the history of the world: A government by the People, for the People and of the People. As for me, that in part means this:"
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"That all the special interests, all the political insiders, all those used to manipulating government and policy for their own benefit — this is just not your time."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"I promise you now, what I promised during the campaign. Things will be different; things will be very different. Together we are tasked with righting the wrongs that have broken the trust of the Alaska People. And I’ll work with all my energy, dedication, and ability to do exactly what I promised you I would do."
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,I look forward to working with each and every one of you in this room. No more of the tired old approaches:
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We must reduce senseless crime.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We must balance our budget.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We must protect the PFD.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,We must grow our economy and put Alaskans back to work.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,And by doing this the Alaskan people will once again trust their leaders.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,Thank you for allowing me to speak to you this evening.
Alaska,Mike Dunleavy,Republican,"God bless you, and God bless the great State of Alaska."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Chief Justice Bales, Members of the Legislature, Judiciary and fellow Arizonans — I am so honored to be back here today, and just like you, I am ready to get to work."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"2018 brought a lot our way. Election years tend to do that for people in our business. Elections also bring change and new faces, as we see here today — and in government, that’s a really good thing. Let’s work together in the months ahead to transform our promises into progress for the state we all love."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"To all who were sworn in for the first time today, and to the other public servants who took the oath with me last week, congratulations and welcome. It wasn’t so long ago that I was new here, too. I ran because I cared, believed I could make a difference, and felt we needed some fresh ideas. No doubt, you’re all here for many of the same reasons."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"You’ve also lucked out, because you’ve got some real pros here to show you the ropes. Speaker Bowers and President Fann — you’re well suited and well prepared for these new roles. I’m hoping today’s not the last day you’ll have my back."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Leaders Fernandez and Bradley — I’m looking forward to working together. I think we can all agree, there’s plenty of opportunities to find common ground."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Bipartisanship is a word that gets tossed around a lot. And today, it seems everyone has their own definition. So let me be clear on the approach I intend to take. I’m not here just to work with Republicans on Republican ideas. And bipartisanship doesn’t simply mean working with Democrats on Democratic ideas. I’m here as governor of all the people to work with all of you on good ideas."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And now’s the time to do so. Because the state of our state is strong, and it’s getting stronger. The challenge before us is to lay the groundwork today to make sure the Arizona of tomorrow remains strong. Doing so requires action now to do thethings that matter and secure Arizona’s future."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"The issues we need to tackle aren’t partisan ones. In some cases, they aren’t even political. At the top of that list: securing our water future."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Now stay with me — this is not an issue that leads the news. It doesn’t make for a snappy headline, or a provocative soundbite, and it can’t be explained in 280 characters. But as I traveled the state this past year, it’s one of the issues I was asked about most by real people -- especially in rural Arizona."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,It’s an issue that deserves your focus and attention. Which is why it’s first on my list.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Here’s the bottom line: We’re in a 19-year drought. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican, Arizona and our neighboring states draw more water from the Colorado River than Mother Nature puts back.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,It’s time to protect Lake Mead and Arizona. It’s time to ratify the Drought Contingency Plan and we have 17 days to do it.                                                                 
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Doing so will require compromise. No one stakeholder is going to get everything they want. Everyone is going to have to give. And I’ve been impressed by the willingness of those involved to do just that.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,It’s been said: whiskey’s for drinking; water’s for fighting.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We have two leaders here today who’ve got the scars to prove it. They are giants, who deserve the credit for getting Arizona to this point — not to mention our gratitude for their lifetime of public service: Governor Bruce Babbitt and Senator Jon Kyl."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Bruce Babbitt served in public office for 20 years, first as Arizona Attorney General and Governor and later as Secretary of the Interior under President Bill Clinton."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Jon Kyl served Arizona in Congress for 26 years, including three terms as a U.S. Senator. Then, when Arizona needed him most, he returned to the Senate last September."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Governor Babbitt and Senator Kyl have shown us the path. Working with others. Setting aside differences. Putting our state, and the greater good first."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Now it’s our turn to do the heavy lifting.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,This issue is important and it’s urgent. Our economy. Our environment. Our future.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s prove we can work together in a bipartisan fashion and get this done.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Same goes for a lot of other things, frankly."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We’ve implemented a hiring freeze and held the line on out of control growth in government. Today, our state government operates more efficiently."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We’ve gotten government out of the way of job creation, cutting red tape and placing a moratorium on new regulations. In fact, we’ve eliminated over 1,000 regulations."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Imagine if we took that same approach this legislative session regarding laws. We’re not short on laws here in our state. Over 107 years we’ve built up a hearty 11,000 plus pages."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Certainly, many of our laws have merit. But many don’t."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,So why does each legislative session seem to be a competition to pass the most new laws?
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"What if we found a way to get rid of old unneeded laws, rather than just creating new ones?  If for every law we passed, we repealed three or if new laws had sunsets."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"I’m challenging this legislature let’s chop the stacks and stacks of statutes down, so that the laws make sense and are relevant to the Arizona of today."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And how about we start with eliminating the most unnecessary law of them all: legislative immunity.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We are a nation of laws, not men. No one -- not me, nor you -- is above the law."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Now, congress likes to exempt themselves from the law -- but isn’t that why Americans hold them in such contempt?"
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s show the people of Arizona that their elected leaders will live under the same laws as every man and woman in this state.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Send T.J. Shope’s referral to the ballot and let the people speak on special privileges for elected officials. 
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And when there are emerging issues that need to be addressed, let’s not ignore them -- let’s solve them."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"One year ago, most of us didn’t know Parkland, Florida, even existed. But now, tragically, it’s another on the list. Ingrained in our memories and American vernacular. Columbine. Virginia Tech. Sandy Hook."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"So last spring, I convened Arizonans in my office. Parents. Teachers. Principals. Law enforcement. Prosecutors. Mental health experts. Democrats and Republicans. People who weren’t Democrats or Republicans. Students themselves. With a goal of being proactive, and taking action to stop a tragedy from happening here. We researched the five deadliest school shootings of the last 20 years, and asked: How could these have been prevented?"
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,We built a plan that could make a real difference: The Safe Arizona Schools Plan. More cops on campus. More school counselors. Improved background checks. A STOP order that protects Second Amendment rights while keeping guns out of the hands of individuals who are a lethal threat.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"These are solutions that will make schools safer, and it’s time for us to get it done. I’ll be including some elements of this plan in my budget that you’ll see Friday -- with an even greater investment than I proposed last year."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We know when a police officer is around, it makes things safer. Who do we call whenever there’s trouble?  Our brave men and women in blue. And that’s why we’re including enough dollars to put a cop on every campus that needs one."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And I’ll be working with legislative leaders to pass the rest.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,This plan is a reasoned and balanced approach. Which is why thought leaders like David French at the National Review and Hugh Hewitt have endorsed it; why the Arizona PTA supports it; and why we modeled elements of it from Gabby Giffords’ plan.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,This is simply too important an issue to let partisan politics and special interests get in the way. We’ve got a responsibility to do something for our kids -- and we’ve got to do it this session.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Whether it’s water or school safety -- these are things that matter. We know that.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We’ve been here before. We did it on Prop 123 -- who thought that lawsuit would ever get settled? We did it with the 20-year extension of 301 -- nobody believed that would happen. University bonding -- the obituaries were written on it, but we got it done. Opioids -- a unanimous vote of the entire Legislature."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And it was just 8 months ago we delivered a 20 percent pay raise for hardworking teachers.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"When we unveiled that proposal, many said it was not possible. And there’s no doubt, forces were standing in the way. But because of teachers -- lots of them -- and principals, and superintendents, PTAs, parents, education champions and business leaders -- with the leadership of J.D. Mesnard, and former President Yarbrough. With bipartisan support from leaders like David Bradley, Sean Bowie, Andrea Dalessandro and Steve Farley, we got that pay raise passed and into teachers’ paychecks."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Half of this commitment was added last fall, with some school leaders going even further. Payson. Yuma. Marana. The Washington Elementary School District, right up the street. Many others."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And to anyone out there considering using these resources somewhere else, I have one message - don’t even think about it. These are raises teachers earned and they are raises we are going to fulfill and protect."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And more is needed on K-12 education. A focus on results, resources and reforms."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Arizona has been the leader in school choice. It’s good for parents, and most of all, it’s good for kids."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Healthy choice and competition brings about innovation, and that’s been the case in Arizona public education. But we also know improvements can be made. More transparency, more accountability, and granting more financial review and oversight over taxpayer dollars -- all with the purpose of making sure every public school is improving and providing Arizona kids with the best-possible education."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Same goes for addressing the teacher shortage.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"In my past life, I used to tell my team at Cold Stone Creamery -- if you find a good idea, grab it. So as we built Cold Stone -- we borrowed ideas from others: McDonald’s. Subway. Starbucks."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And I confess -- I’ve kept the habit going.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Four years ago, I heard what sounded like a really good idea to address the teacher shortage. If someone graduates from an Arizona university, is willing to stay in Arizona, and teach in a public school, why not allow them to graduate debt-free by providing a scholarship?"
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"So we turned it into reality and launched the Arizona Teachers Academy. Already, 221 students have started moving through the program."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"This year we plan to significantly expand it: more dollars, more support. We are going to create a pipeline of talent and the next generation of Arizona teachers."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And today, as a guest of Angela and I -- we have the person who came up with the idea. He’s had an incredible career of public service, he’s continuing that service as newest member of the Arizona Board of Regents, and his wife, Jennifer, is with him today. Arizona thanks you, Fred Duval."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Education and our economy go hand in hand.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Many of us remember a class back when we were in high school called shop.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"It's where a lot of good people discovered a passion, they turned into a purpose, and then a pretty good paycheck."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Our education leaders are creating the ""shop"" classes of the 21st century-- it’s called Career and Technical Education-- CTE."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Today, students in these programs are training to becoming nurses, pilots, pharmacists, bankers, firefighters and software developers -- all before graduation."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"In fact, 99 percent of CTE students graduate high school--99 percent-- a rate much higher than the national average."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,They perform better in mathematics and reading -- and their technical skills rival professionals in the same trade.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Just take a look at some of these programs: Aviation at Pima Community College. Advanced manufacturing at Maricopa Community Colleges. Diesel mechanics at the Western Maricopa Education Center. And culinary arts at the East Valley Institute of Technology.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Today, we have more jobs available in the state of Arizona than we have people to fill them."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Whatever and wherever the skilled trade is needed, Arizona is prepared to meet the demand."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,I want to recognize education leaders who are paving the way:
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Lee Lambert, Maria Harper-Marinick, Greg Donovan, Doug Pruitt, and Sally Downey. Thank you for your leadership."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"These are programs we plan to build, expand and align with the jobs of tomorrow. And my budget will do just that."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"If people want to work, let’s let them work! 100,000 people will move here this year. There’s a job available for every one of them. Lots of them are trained and certified in other states. Standing in their way of earning a living in Arizona, our own licensing boards, and their cronies who tell them -- “You can’t work here. You haven’t paid the piper.”"
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s stop this foolishness. Pass Warren Petersen’s bill to grant universal recognition for all occupational licenses-- and let them work.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And before those unelected boards feign outrage – let’s remember: workers don't lose their skills simply because they move to Arizona.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And, in the name of good government, let’s have the bullies on these boards answer three questions: what do you exist to do, how do you know if you’re doing it well, and who would miss you if you were gone? "
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,There’s dignity in all work. 
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Last fall, I visited our state prison in Buckeye, Arizona. There, joined by Arizona Cardinals defensive back Antoine Bethea and D lineman Corey Peters along with Cardinals President Michael Bidwill, we saw the possibilities of Opportunity for All first hand."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"At a job fair, soon-to-be-released men and women were excited to participate in a program that equips them with the skills to successfully re-enter society. They lined up at employers like Jacksons Car Wash and Hickman’s Family Farms -- some left with multiple job offers."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,This is a program we need to secure well into the 21st century to protect public safety and reduce Arizona’s prison population.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican," Arizona’s economy is booming. There’s no doubt about it. We’ve added nearly 300,000 new jobs in the last four years."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican," And I’m proud to say, our relationship with Mexico is stronger than ever. With an updated North American trade deal, known as the USMCA, this will mean even more trade coming through our ports and more jobs for Arizonans."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"I’ve become fond of saying that the last time unemployment was this low, you were renting your movies at Blockbuster."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"But the benchmark is moving. By the end of this year, unemployment is forecasted to plummet to levels we haven’t seen since before you knew what a hashtag was."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Some said the teacher pay raise was unsustainable and based on rosy projections. Turns out those projections weren’t rosy -- they were in response to a growing economy that has led to a record balance in our general fund.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"When I stood here four years ago, we faced a $1 billion deficit. It’s not by accident that today, we’ve got a $1 billion surplus."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Arizona weathered the storm. Made tough decisions. Held the line on raising taxes and will continue to hold the line on raising taxes.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,And breaking news: somebody call The Daily Show -- we even own this building again.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"It’s the Arizona way, it’s a winning game plan, and I have no intention of changing course."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Government didn’t rebuild Arizona. People rebuilt their businesses. They hired and invested. Workers and families rolled up their sleeves.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"So for their sake, let’s make sure we’re on strong footing today and into the future."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"With revenue soaring, some have suggested loosen up, let the good times roll."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Ladies and gentleman: We’ve seen that movie before, and we know how it ends."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"It wasn’t that long ago that this state racked up a massive tab, went on a spending binge, with no long-term plan of how to pay for any of it. And when the economy tanked -- every one of those false promises evaporated. "
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"It was painful, for real people. Let’s learn from the mistakes of the past."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"To the big spenders: On November 6th, the people spoke. They want their teachers paid and their budgets balanced."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"So, the balanced budget I will present to you on Friday fully funds the priorities we know are important -- public safety, child safety, education -- above and beyond inflation. There are some targeted investments in critical areas. But frankly, for a surplus year, this budget is pretty light reading."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Because I’m proposing that we secure Arizona’s future and prepare responsibly for the unexpected and the inevitable -- by bringing our Rainy Day Fund, to record-breaking balance of one billion dollars."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"If ever there were a way to protect public education, to protect the pay raises our teachers have earned and deserve, to prevent budget gimmicks, band-aids and massive cuts down the line; to avoid tax increases and budget standoffs and government shutdowns -- it’s through this thoughtful, prudent and fiscally-conservative approach."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Four years ago, as a new governor, I inherited 35,000 hardworking state employees, 40 billion in combined spending, over 200 boards and commissions and 43 plus state agencies. We got to work restructuring a government that should operate at the speed of business."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We’ve made a lot of progress. We’ve got less bureaucracy, more efficiencies. And still, more can be done. Remember when Andy Tobin worked his way out of a job?"
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Well, buckle your seatbelts because there’s going to be a lot more of that as we look to save taxpayer dollars and streamline state government."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And our dedicated state employees will continue to play a critical role in shaping our direction. We’ll rely on their expertise, and know-how as we apply technology and customer service techniques to further consolidate our government."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"This is another non-partisan issue. It’s not Republican versus Democrat. In our nation’s capitol, both parties are equally guilty for bloated government, spending sprees and unmanageable debt. If anything it’s an Arizona versus Washington, D.C. issue. The federal government is broke, broken and broken-down, and has been for decades. Washington could learn a lot from us."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"When the federal government failed to secure our border, we created the Border Strike Force, combating crime without interrupting trade. "
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We know the value of time, so we reduced wait-times at the MVD."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Our Department of Child Safety has become a national model and the envy of other states.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And yes, when congress failed to do their job, we kept the gates of the Grand Canyon open. "
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"I’ve spent a lot of time these last four years, making a lot of new friends. I’ve been to every county. In dozens of schools. In our state agencies. Businesses -- large and small. It’s been fun and pretty darn delicious. The chocolate chip cookies at Beyond Bread in Tucson. The Especial at Lute’s Casino in Yuma. And you’ve got to try the pies at The Mogollon Moose out in Payson. Let’s just say you don’t have to guess my new year’s resolution."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,We’ve got great people in this state. Some have been here for generations -- others just got here yesterday.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"And then there are those we said goodbye to last year for the final time. Their memory, and their legacies will live on: "
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Congressman Ed Pastor
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Superintendent of Public Instruction Carolyn Warner
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Treasurer Carol Springer
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Chief Justice Bud Jones
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Senator John McCain
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Others had names we were not familiar with -- their lives cut short in the line of duty. Their service will be honored and remembered all the same:
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Chief Warrant Officer Taylor Galvin
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Staff Sergeant Alexander Conrad
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,First Sergeant Nicholas Amsberry
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Army Specialist Robert Jones 
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,U.S. Deputy Marshal Chase White
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Nogales Police Officer Jesus Cordova
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Salt River Police Officer Clayton Townsend
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Trooper Tyler Edenhofer
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us of the sacrifices made every day by our heroes in uniform -- law enforcement, first responders, correctional officers, our National Guard, and military personnel. We salute you. We are proud of you. And we thank you."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"We know that to truly secure Arizona’s future, we can’t do it without you. And we pledge to continue to support and invest in you and your families."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen of the Legislature -- we’ve got our work cut out for us. But with the leadership here, and the passion and purpose that you and I bring to the issues that face us, I have high hopes and great enthusiasm that this will be our most productive session yet."
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s put party labels aside.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s put Arizona first.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s do the things that matter.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Let’s get to work.
Arizona,Doug Ducey,Republican,Thank you and God bless.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,Lt. Gov. Griffin; Speaker Shepherd; President Hendren; Mr. Chief Justice; and honored Members of the General Assembly.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,This is truly an occasion to celebrate. You are celebrating. We are celebrating. It is exciting. But it is also a time to reflect and to set a determined course for the future.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As part of the celebration, I have my family here today. My wife, Susan; my son Asa III; Sarah and Dave, my daughter and son-in-law; John Paul and Nubia; and Young Seth and Julia. Thank you for being here and a part of this."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"I have four grandchildren here today: Ella Beth, Malcolm, Isabella, and John Pablo. Maybe John Pablo took a leave of absence because he’s young."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"It is a special privilege to have my family here who have been along this journey with me, and it’s important for them to share in this important occasion."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As we convene today to begin a new term in office, we can rejoice that the election is over. The seasons have changed, and we are now entering the winter of hard work. As we do so, we are reminded that the true purpose of political victory is service."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,A simple but profound phrase: We serve the public. Not a party; not personal interests. We serve the public.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Some of you may not be aware. You’ve been in my office; maybe you’ve come directly to visit with me. But if you go in the door of my office, and you look left, you will see a box. It is a shoeshine kit. It is in my office, and there’s a plaque on there that says, “This is to remind you of your youth in Gravette.” In Gravette I shined shoes at Johnny’s Barbershop as my first job. I shined shoes for 25 cents and boots for 50 cents, because they were muddy."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"I have that in my office because it reminds me of my roots, and it reminds me of the dignity of work."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"So, members of the General Assembly, during the session, come on by the Governor's office and get your shoes shined."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As we consider the upcoming session, we also realize very quickly that there is nothing we can do alone. It takes all of us working together for the people of Arkansas."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"And if we toil well and together, then this spring we will be able to see the first fruits of our labor, and in due time, we will enjoy the full harvest when good policy strengthens public confidence; when good policy builds hope; and when good policy serves the cause of justice."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Today, as is our custom, we began our new leadership with a prayer service at the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center. And justice was one of the themes of that ceremony. Later, we will go out to the public ceremony, and we will have our poet laureate, Jo McDougall, read a poem that I commissioned, on the theme of hope in Arkansas."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"I believe that we will all agree today that Arkansas is an amazing place to live, raise a family, and build our own special future."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"It hasn't always been easy. Arkansans have had our share of challenge and difficulty. The most challenging time was during the Great Depression. During that time, we were poor. But we did not lose population. Our population did not decline. People stayed here because poverty was all over the nation. That was the 1930s."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"But when the economy boomed again after the war, the jobs out of state offered better pay. Between 1940 and 1960, over 150,000 people left our state. Some of our best left for Michigan, California, and Chicago."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"But now that trend is reversed. People are moving to Arkansas from California, Michigan, and Illinois, and we are retaining our homegrown talent. Our population is now over 3 million people and growing every day."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"The lesson is that if people follow opportunity and pursue quality of life, they are going to come to Arkansas. We have it all."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,That is why we work so hard to be competitive in our tax rates; to compete for industry and businesses locating in this state; to build a technology sector; to expand tourism; and to improve access to the arts and to education.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As evidence of these new opportunities, we have moved more than 65,000 Arkansans over the last four years out of poverty and into work. They have jobs and are making more money. Fewer Arkansans are on Medicaid, and fewer are having to rely upon the important safety net of SNAP and other benefits because they have more opportunity."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"We have also proven that we can lead in entrepreneurship, agriculture, global retail trade, and technology education."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Before we forge into the future today, it is important to note what we have accomplished together."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have reformed our child welfare system. Three years ago, you approved $24 million additional funding for our child welfare programs, and the result is a 30 percent increase in foster beds; the result is 22 percent increase in caseworkers; and the result is nearly 1,000 fewer children in foster care. We initiated the Restore Hope Summit where our faith-based leaders and government partners figured out ways to work together."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,Thank you for making a difference for our children.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have reformed our criminal justice system, and as a result, the growth of our prison population has been reduced. Four years ago, we were growing at the rate of 3 percent per year in our prison population. The growth rate has been reduced to 1 percent per year."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"We have invested more in reentry centers to give people a second chance in life. More than 1,200 inmates have graduated through our reentry facilities, and this results in a lower incarceration rate, more people working, and a reduced burden on taxpayers."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"We want to give people a second chance in life after they have paid the penalty for any wrongdoing, and I am proud of our employers who give them a chance!"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"One illustration is Steven Edwards. He is an example of a person who got a second chance and is succeeding. Steven was convicted of first-degree murder at the age of 16. He spent nearly 20 years in prison. During that time, he got his GED; he earned a diploma from Ozarka College; and he earned a bachelor's degree through correspondence from Ohio University. Steven became the first inmate in our correction system to accomplish those educational goals while incarcerated."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"The Parole Board gave Steven a second chance and reduced his sentence. He moved to Marion, where his first job out of prison was at an eye-care clinic. A patient heard his story and hired him to teach GED classes at the juvenile center in West Memphis."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Then he started a lawn-care company with two push mowers from Wal-Mart. Now, he has 80 clients, owns his own home, pays taxes, and tells his story at teen summits."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,Steven Edwards got a second chance. We need to give everyone who is willing to change and contribute that second chance in life.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Four years ago, we had a scholarship lottery that was declining each year in the amount of scholarships for our students. We transformed the lottery from an independent agency into part of the Department of Finance. The result is that we have cut administrative costs and lottery student scholarships have grown by 26 percent. They have increased from $72 million in 2015 to over $91 million this last year. That’s effective government work that we did together."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"We had an off-course, behind-schedule, and discredited effort to put high-speed internet in our schools. We didn't let it ride; we changed course and built the Arkansas Public School Computer Network. At that time, we became one of only six states in the country to fully deploy the highest broadband internet to every school in our state."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have lowered taxes for everyone making less than $75,000 in this state; and we have recruited industry to this state from Sig Sauer in Jacksonville to EnviroTech in Helena/West Helena to Glatfelter in Fort Smith to Conifex in El Dorado and Glenwood, with hundreds more businesses moving here or expanding in our state."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have invested in technology education, and as a result, we lead the nation in computer science education of our students. It started with an idea; a modest investment; and legislative support. It now sets an example for states from California to North Carolina."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have invested in pre-K education. Our budget for pre-K has increased from $111 million to $114 million in recent years. We rank 17th nationally in spending on pre-K and Number 18 in four-year-old pre-K access; and we rank Number 5 in the nation in terms of three- year-old access to early education."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have cut the size and inefficiency of government. We have worked with you to cut the red tape. We repealed over 800 outdated and unnecessary regulations, which makes state government less burdensome to taxpayers and businesses."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"We have reduced the size of the executive branch of state government by more than 1,400 employees. That is a reduction of over 5 percent. This is through improved management practices and attrition, but we can do more."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have transformed a wasteful healthcare system to make sure our health care assistance is available to those who need it most. Think about the abuse of Preferred Family Healthcare, which sucked millions of dollars out of Medicaid into the hands of executives. All at the cost of our behavioral-health population."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"It has not been easy, but together, we have changed the rules to reduce waste and the potential for abuse in Medicaid payments."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"And when it comes to the disability waiting list, we did something about it, and for the first time in decades, we provided help to these families and created a way to reduce the waiting list further. This helps families and maximizes the lives of those with disabilities."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"One year ago, I stood in this chamber, and I reported to you on the story of Wendie and Wade Reaves and their daughter, Regan. Today, I want to give you an update. As you remember, Regan was one of the more than 3,000 on the disability waiting list hoping for services to improve their lives. She had been on the list for eight years."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Then we together allowed $8.5 million every year for those in need of services, Regan was off the list and got the help she needed. Now Regan’s, mom, Wendie, reports she has been able to get a full-time job for the first time since Regan was born. Regan is learning new skills with the help of her waiver worker. Wendy reports that, ""The first time Regan learned to wash her hair by herself was a big day."""
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,What we do in these chambers and in public service makes a difference in the lives of people.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Together, we have changed our state budget from one that spends it all to one that creates savings for more difficult times. We now have the Long-Term Reserve Fund. The current balance is over $125 million."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"So when it comes to the future, we have an understanding from history that our future is brightest when we embrace the new, and we create growth. Remember, the voters supported us and gave us approval for a growth agenda. We cannot let them down."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Let's not let this moment in history pass us by, but let us work together for success."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,Let's work together and make history by reversing the trend of high taxes in Arkansas; let’s make history by transforming state government; let’s make history by raising teacher pay to historic levels in our state; and let’s make history by focusing on a growth agenda that allows Arkansans to prosper.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"I have submitted my balanced budget to you, and it includes additional funding for public safety with 30 additional probation and parole officers. It also includes $2.3 million for an increase of 24 new troopers over the next two years."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"The Arkansas State Police is our top law-enforcement agency, and we must support our law enforcement. And Arkansas does."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Recently, Corporal Clayton McWilliams was severely injured in the line of duty. The citizens of Ashdown had a fundraiser to support Corporal McWilliams, and more than 500 attended and raised over $50,000. Well done, Ashdown!"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"The budget includes $60 million allocated for raising the minimum teacher pay by $4,000 over the next four years."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"And recognizing that agriculture is our state's number one industry, my budget includes a much- needed increase in funding of $1.1 million for the Division of Agriculture. It includes $1.5 million increase in budget for University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, as well."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Our proposed budget includes sufficient funding for programs that provide a critical safety net for our citizens, and that is why it is important to continue funding at $2.5 million per year of our Crisis Stabilization Units. The CSUs. The CSU's provide a treatment option for those suffering from mental illness rather than incarceration or just simply ignoring their needs."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As you know, we have dramatically increased our numbers in computer science courses in Arkansas. Last school year, we were at about 6,000, and this year we have more than 8,000 students in high school taking computer coding. That is a 30 percent increase."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,One of the key results of this initiative is that more technology companies are locating in Arkansas or are being created here. One of my goals for Arkansas is to be a hub of technology companies that will provide new opportunity and diversity to our economy.
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"For that reason, I am calling for the creation of a private sector Technology and Innovation Council. This Innovation Council will bring industry leaders and technology entrepreneurs together to create new energy and support for tomorrow's problem solvers and thought leaders in software design, cyber security, data analytics, blockchain technology, and all those other things that you’re expert in."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"When it comes to our goals for the future, to me it comes down to a growth agenda. I know I talk about that a lot. But it’s a plan for Arkansas that includes more and better paying jobs; increased attainment levels in higher education; a strong diversified economy; and competitive tax rates."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"That is why the third phase of tax cuts is planned for this session. Four years ago, I signed into law the tax cut for the middle-income category. This reduced tax rates for those making between"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"$20,000 and $75,000 per year."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"In 2017, we came together and passed the second phase of our overall tax-cut plan with a $50 million reduction for lower income Arkansans. This includes those making less than $20,000 per year."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"At this point, 90 percent of all Arkansas taxpayers have received a tax cut, but we have more to accomplish. I applaud the work and recommendations of the Legislative Task Force that worked for two years in analyzing and making recommendations. While I wanted to flatten the rate for all taxpayers to 5.9 percent over the next 4 years, the task force wisely said we should also simplify the rate structure and to raise the standard deduction for all taxpayers."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"The result is a plan that we call the 2-4-5.9 plan. It will set Arkansas on a path to be competitive with our surrounding states; to attract new investments and talent in our state; and to continue our vigorous economic growth. We will work with you to make sure that this plan reduces taxes, and that we will hold everyone harmless so that no taxpayer will see any tax increase."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"For those who think we need to do more, I remind you that the 2-4-5.9 plan reduces revenue by $47.4 million in the first year; but everyone should also note that in the same year, we will be reducing the grocery tax by $61.1 million, and then the low-income goes into effect, that’s $50 million. So the total tax reductions will be around $158 million."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"For those who are concerned about the tax cuts and meeting the other needs of our state, please note that in the last four years, we have cut taxes carefully. And we have continued to invest in education, in prisons, public safety, and even funding expanded Medicaid in this state. And we have set aside, during that same time, over $125 million in savings. Those commitments remain. Carefulness. Commitment. Meeting our obligations in education and services. But let’s not take our eye off the ball of competitive tax rates in this state."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Today, we have a budget that allows for tax cuts while investing in the future. We have demonstrated we can get this done. And we will do it again."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As we think about the last four years and look forward to what the future holds, it is more than fitting that we recognize those who serve our state and nation in the Arkansas National Guard and our military branches. Without their leadership and service, we could not get the job done in terms of security and services in times of natural disaster in our state. Thank you, men and women, for your service."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Thirty-two years ago, I had the opportunity to meet with President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office. It was my first time in the White House, so I was trying to memorize everything about it."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"As I was in the oval office, I noticed on the president’s desk two mottos. They caught my attention. One was, ""It is amazing what can be accomplished when you don't care who gets the credit."" The other motto was a simple phrase: ""It can be done."""
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"When I think about how hard it is to transform government, we need to remind ourselves: ""It can be done."""
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"When I worry about reaching an agreement on a new highway-funding plan: let’s remind ourselves, “It can be done.”"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"When we ponder the requirement of a three-fourths vote for lowering and simplifying our income tax rates in Arkansas, let’s remind ourselves: “It can be done.”"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"When I look at the need to raise minimum teacher pay in Arkansas, we know: “It can be done,” and it must be done."
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Let me add one phrase as I conclude today’s remarks—one phrase to the president’s desk motto: That is. “Together, it can be done.”"
Arkansas,Asa Hutchinson,Republican,"Thank you, and may God bless this General Assembly, the work ahead, and the people of this Great State."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Mr. Speaker, thank you for being a champion for all Californians – and for welcoming Jen and me into your house today."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Madam Pro Tem – thank you for your commitment to collaboration, which has helped make our first month together so productive."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I also have the honor of saying for the first time ever in this chamber: thank you Madam Lieutenant Governor for that very kind and short introduction.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,To all the constitutional officers and legislators assembled here today – thank you for your service to our state.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,And let me reassure everyone: our son Dutch is not here. We learned our lesson at the inauguration.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,It was just over four weeks ago that I stood in front of this Capitol and pledged to defend not just the California constitution but the California dream.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Today, I want to talk about how we can do that together."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"By every traditional measure, the state of our state is strong."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We have a record-breaking surplus.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We’ve added 3 million jobs since the depths of the recession.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Wages are rising.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We have more scientists, researchers, and engineers, more Nobel laureates, and the finest system of higher education anywhere in the world."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"But along with that prosperity and progress, there are problems that have been deferred for too long and that threaten to put the California dream out of reach for too many."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We face hard decisions that are coming due.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,The choices we make will shape our future for decades.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"This is what I want to talk about today, as frankly and directly as I can:"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The tough calls we must make together on rail, water, and energy. How we protect migrants, care for seniors, and help the homeless, and how we will tackle the affordability crisis that is coming to define life in this state."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I won’t pretend to have all the answers. But the only way to find them is to face these issues honestly.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Let’s start with the fear mongering from the White House about the so-called “emergency” at our border.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"For me, this is an echo from 15 years ago."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I was a new mayor sitting in the gallery at the State of the Union when President Bush said LGBT Americans should not be able to get married.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"It was an attack on our friends and neighbors, and on California’s values."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I was so proud to watch brave Californians answer those attacks with love and courage. Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin made history when they were married 15 years ago to this very day.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Now, just like back then, we must stand up for those maligned, marginalized, and scapegoated."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Because last week, we heard another president stand up at the State of the Union and offer a vision of an America fundamentally at odds with California values."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"He described a country where inequality doesn’t seem to be a problem, where climate change doesn’t exist, and where the greatest threat we face comes from families seeking asylum."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Just last night, he went down to El Paso and said it again."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Let us state the facts. We are currently experiencing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"In California, like our nation, our undocumented population is at its lowest level in more than a decade."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Some 550,000 fewer in our state alone."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Immigrants, both those here legally and those without documentation, commit crime at a lower rate than native-born citizens."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"And those families, women and children, seeking asylum at our borders, are doing so lawfully."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Those are the facts. The border “emergency” is a manufactured crisis and California will not be part of this political theater.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We’re not backing down. Just yesterday, I gave the National Guard a new mission – one that will refocus on the real threats facing our state."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"A third of our forces currently on the border will be redeployed to help prepare for the upcoming fire season by joining CAL FIRE in prevention and suppression. Work, ironically, the federal government curtailed during the recent shutdown."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Another third will boost the National Guard’s statewide Counterdrug Task Force by redeploying up north to go after illegal cannabis farms, many of which are run by cartels, are devastating our pristine forests, and are increasingly becoming fire hazards themselves."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,The remaining third of our Guard will focus on stopping criminals smuggling drugs and guns through existing border checkpoints.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,A wall that stretches thousands of miles through the wilderness will do nothing to stop this threat.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"This is our answer to the White House: No more division, no more xenophobia and no more nativism. We suffered enough from that in the nineties with Props 187 and 227."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Next, let’s level about High-Speed Rail. I have nothing but respect for Governor Brown’s and Governor Schwarzenegger’s ambitious vision. I share it. And there’s no doubt that our state’s economy and quality of life depend on improving transportation."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"But let’s be real. The project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long. There’s been too little oversight and not enough transparency."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Right now, there simply isn’t a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego, let alone from San Francisco to LA. I wish there were."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"However, we do have the capacity to complete a high-speed rail link between Merced and Bakersfield."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I know that some critics will say this is a “train to nowhere.” But that’s wrong and offensive. The people of the Central Valley endure the worst air pollution in America as well as some of the longest commutes. And they have suffered too many years of neglect from policymakers here in Sacramento. They deserve better.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,High-Speed Rail is much more than a train project. It’s about economic transformation and unlocking the enormous potential of the Valley.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We can align our economic and workforce development strategies, anchored by High-Speed Rail, and pair them with tools like opportunity zones, to form the backbone of a reinvigorated Central Valley economy."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Merced, Fresno, Bakersfield, and communities in between are more dynamic than many realize."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The Valley may be known around the world for agriculture, but there is another story ready to be told. A story of a region hungry for investment, a workforce eager for more training and good jobs, Californians who deserve a fair share of our state’s prosperity."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Look, we will continue our regional projects north and south. We’ll finish Phase 1 environmental work. We’ll connect the revitalized Central Valley to other parts of the state, and continue to push for more federal funding and private dollars. But let’s just get something done."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"For those who want to walk away from this whole endeavor, I offer you this:"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Abandoning high-speed rail entirely means we will have wasted billions of dollars with nothing but broken promises and lawsuits to show for it.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"And by the way, I am not interested in sending $3.5 billion in federal funding that was allocated to this project back to Donald Trump."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Nor am I interested in repeating the same old mistakes.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Today I am ordering new transparency measures.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We’re going to hold contractors and consultants accountable to explain how taxpayer dollars are spent – including change orders, cost overruns, even travel expenses. It’s going online, for everybody to see."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"You’re also going to see some governance changes, starting with my pick for the next chair of the High-Speed Rail Authority, Lenny Mendonca, my Economic Development Director. Because, at the end of the day, transportation and economic development must go hand in hand."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We also need a fresh approach when it comes to meeting California’s massive water challenges.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We have a big state with diverse water needs. Cities that need clean water to drink, farms that need irrigation to keep feeding the world, fragile ecosystems that must be protected."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Our water supply is becoming less reliable because of climate change. And our population is growing because of a strong economy. That means a lot of demand on an unpredictable supply. There are no easy answers.  But let me be direct about where I stand:
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I do not support the Water Fix as currently configured. Meaning, I do not support the twin tunnels. But we can build on the important work that’s already been done. That’s why I do support a single tunnel."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,The status quo is not an option.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We need to protect our water supply from earthquakes and rising sea levels, preserve delta fisheries, and meet the needs of cities and farms."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We have to get past the old binaries, like farmers versus environmentalists, or North versus South. Our approach can’t be “either/or.”  It must be “yes/and.”"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Conveyance and efficiency. And recycling projects like we’re seeing in Southern California’s Met Water District, expanding floodplains in the Central Valley, groundwater recharge, like farmers are doing in Fresno County. We need a portfolio approach to building water infrastructure and meeting long-term demand."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"To help bring this balance, I’m appointing a new chair of the California water board, Joaquin Esquivel."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Our first task is to cross the finish line on real agreements to save the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We must get this done – for the resilience of our mighty rivers, the stability of our agriculture sector, and the millions who depend on this water every day."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Now, let’s talk honestly about clean drinking water."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Just this morning, more than a million Californians woke up without clean water to bathe in or drink. Some schools have shut down drinking fountains due to contamination. Some poorer communities, like those I visited recently in Stanislaus County, are paying more for undrinkable water than Beverly Hills pays for its pristine water."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"This is a moral disgrace and a medical emergency. There are literally hundreds of water systems across the state contaminated by lead, arsenic, or uranium."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Solving this crisis demands sustained funding. It demands political will.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Next, let’s talk about our energy future – and PG&E’s bankruptcy."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We are all frustrated and angry that it’s come to this. PG&E didn’t do enough to secure dangerous equipment or plan for the future. My administration will work to make sure PG&E upholds its obligations. I have convened a team of the nation’s best bankruptcy lawyers and financial experts from the energy sector.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"They will work with my strike team to develop a comprehensive strategy that we will present within 60 days. We will ensure continued access to safe affordable power. We will seek justice for fire victims, fairness for employees, and protection for ratepayers. We will continue to invest in safety, and we will never waver on achieving the nation’s most ambitious clean energy goals."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The problems we face are far greater than PG&E. Climate change is putting pressure on all of our utilities—public and private, north and south. Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric both recently had their credit ratings downgraded."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,This pressure comes at a time when the entire energy market is evolving. From roof-top solar and wind generation to smart grid technologies. From Community Choice Aggregators to direct access service. More and more of our electricity now is procured outside of investor-owned utilities.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Regulations and insurance practices created decades ago didn’t anticipate these changes. We must map out longer-term strategies, not just for the utilities’ future, but for California’s energy future, to ensure that the cost of climate change doesn’t fall on those least able to afford it."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Now let me turn to education.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The teachers’ strike in LA is over — but the need to confront its underlying causes has only just begun. Understaffed schools, overcrowded classrooms, pension pressures, the achievement gap, and charter school growth — these stressors are showing up all over the state, right here in Sacramento, in Fresno, and Oakland."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Districts across the state are challenged to balance budgets even in this strong economy, and at a time when we’re spending more on schools than ever before."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Seven years ago, we invested $47.3 billion in our schools. Next year, with your support, we’ll invest more than $80 billion — that includes $576 million for special education."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,But it’s not enough. We’re still 41st in the nation in per pupil funding. Something needs to change. We need to have an honest conversation about how we fund our schools at a state and local level.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"But at the same time, let’s remember that the measure of a school system’s excellence is more than the sum of its budgets."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We need clear and achievable standards of transparency, more information sharing, and accountability for all public schools … traditional and charter."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We need a new President for the State Board of Education, to lead the way and work alongside State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and to lift up all of our students. And my pick for that position is nationally recognized education expert Linda Darling-Hammond."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,There’s another urgent moral issue we must confront: the homelessness epidemic.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"So many of California’s homeless – whether they’re families, veterans, victims of rent spikes, or survivors fleeing domestic violence – are invisible and left behind by our society. Too many on the streets are suffering from bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or paranoia. Many are self-medicating with drug or alcohol as a consequence. Our homelessness crisis has increasingly become a public health crisis."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Last year, there was a Hepatitis-A outbreak in San Diego. Recently, there was an outbreak of Syphilis in Sonoma. And now, typhus in Los Angeles. Typhus. That’s a Medieval disease. In California. In 2019."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Mayors, county supervisors, and city councils around the state are working hard to reduce homelessness and its underlying causes. We’ve got to have their backs."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"But they can’t do it alone. To help lead this discussion, I’m appointing a new Commission on Homelessness & Supportive Housing, led by Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"With your support, let’s put half a billion dollars into immediate funding for navigation centers — emergency shelters with services on site, and another hundred million for Whole Person Care to replace a fragmented approach to services with one that’s more integrated and comprehensive."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"And while cities and counties are on the front lines, this challenge will only be solved regionally. We need to work together as a state to focus on prevention, rapid rehousing, mental health, and more permanent supportive housing — because while shelter solves sleep, only permanent supportive housing solves homelessness."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Now, let’s talk about something too often overlooked:"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,The Golden State is getting grayer. We need to get ready for the major demographic challenge headed our way.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"For the first time in our history, older Californians will outnumber young children. Over the next decade, our statewide senior population will increase by 4 million. In 25 years, it will double. And more than half will require some form of long-term care."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Growing old knows no boundaries – aging doesn’t care what race you are, your economic status, or if you’re single with no other family support."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I’ve had some personal – and painful – experience with this recently. I lost my father over the holidays, after years of declining physical health and dementia. He was determined to live out his days with dignity. He also happened to be a retired public official with a pension and a support circle of family and friends."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Even with all those advantages, it was a daily challenge to meet his needs so he could live in place and maintain a good quality of life. Millions of Californians share a similar story, and the numbers will only grow."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"It’s time for a new Master Plan on Aging. It must address: person-centered care, the patchwork of public services, social isolation, bed-locked seniors in need of transportation, the nursing shortage, and demand for In-Home Supportive Services that far outpaces its capacity."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,And we can’t talk about aging without focusing on Alzheimer’s.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Too many of us have seen the crushing grip this disease has on our loved ones – and especially on our wives and mothers – two-thirds of new Alzheimer’s cases are women.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Today, I am launching the Alzheimer’s Prevention and Preparedness Task Force, bringing the most renowned scientists and thinkers together to develop first-of-its-kind research in this area. It will be headed by a leading advocate for families dealing with Alzheimer’s, our former first lady, Maria Shriver. She is here today and we are grateful for her continued service."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Tying together many of the hard challenges we face is the broader cost crisis. In a recent survey, 61 percent of young adults in California said they can’t afford to live here. California should never be a place where only the well-off can lead a good life."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"It starts with housing, perhaps our most overwhelming challenge right now. We all know the problem. There’s too much demand and too little supply. And that is happening in large part because too many cities and counties aren’t even planning for how to build. Some are flat out refusing to do anything at all."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"That’s why I have committed $750 million for a major new incentive package for communities to do the right thing. $250 million in support to cities and counties to update their housing plans, revamp their zoning process, and get more housing entitled. $500 million more in grants when they achieve these milestones."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"If we want a California for All, we have to build housing for all."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I want to support local governments that do what’s right, like Anaheim and Santa Rosa. But there must be accountability for those that don’t."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Two weeks ago, the state of California sued the city of Huntington Beach for failing to meet its obligations on affordable housing. Let me tell you, as a former mayor, the last thing I wanted to do was start my term by suing a city. But they left us no choice."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"This isn’t about picking on Huntington Beach, they happened to be first because of a statute of limitations. There are 47 other cities across California that are not complying with their planning requirements in one way or another."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Some cities are trying, like Clovis. But others are not, like Wheatland, Huntington Park, and Montebello. I am inviting these cities’ leaders to sit down next week for a candid conversation. I don’t intend to file suit against all 47, but I’m not going to preside over neglect and denial. These cities need to summon the political courage to build their fair share of housing."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I also want to acknowledge other factors beyond city planning that have limited our ability to provide housing.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"In recent years, we’ve expedited judicial review on CEQA for professional sports. It’s time we do the same thing for housing."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I want to applaud the efforts by home builders and labor leaders, who together are working to forge a compromise to accelerate production."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,But there is no way we can achieve our ambitious targets unless we train a skilled workforce big enough to meet this challenge … and those workers deserve wages high enough to support their families.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Let’s encourage this progress, bring more people to the table, and get something big done. And while we’re at it, let’s not forget the commitments many of us made after Prop 10 failed last year."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The pressures on vulnerable renters didn’t go away after the election. We need new rules to stabilize neighborhoods and prevent evictions, without putting small landlords out of business. I want the best ideas from everyone in this chamber. Here is my promise to you, get me a good package on rent stability this year and I will sign it."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Next, if we’re serious about taming the cost crisis we need affordable healthcare for all Californians."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Our ability to invest in everything we care about is constrained by the pressure of rising health care costs. It impacts everything else we want to do.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The White House is laser-focused on destroying the Affordable Care Act. The vandalism they’ve already done to the individual mandate has had consequences. This year’s Covered California premiums increased almost twice as much as we expected. This is just what we feared, and it’s just what they wanted."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"That’s why, when it comes to the individual mandate, California must act where Washington failed."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"If we do, we will be able to deepen subsidies for those earning up to $48,000 and extend subsidies to families earning up to $150,000, something no other state in America has done. We all know California has among the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rates in America."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,That’s why our budget devotes more than $1 billion to increase rates and address the provider shortage.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"This investment will also allow us to increase access to preventative health measures like -immunizations, trauma screenings, and mental health services. And it provides $100 million for reproductive health and family planning."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"As we pursue the long-term goal of single payer financing, let us make a down-payment now by expanding Medi-Cal coverage to all Californians up to age 26, regardless of their immigration status."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,But access is only part of the solution. Cost is another.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We must address rising costs throughout the system, like the consolidation of hospitals and other health providers, which limits patient choice and makes care more expensive. And we must continue to bring down the cost of prescription drugs."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"My first act as Governor was to lay the foundation for a single-purchasing system – the largest such system in the nation, which will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the people of California."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I want to thank President Trump for calling attention to prescription drug prices in his State of the Union. Yes, you heard that right. I hope he follows through.  After all, this should be a bipartisan issue. But with or without the Federal government, California will lead."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Finally, we must ask ourselves, how do we create a future with more good jobs and higher wages."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Because when it comes to making life in California more affordable, cost is only one side of the equation, the other is income."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Despite our rising wages, working families in California today barely earn more than they did a decade ago. Many working parents are making less than their parents did at the same age."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"That’s why, with your support, we will provide a cost of living refund by expanding the earned income tax credit to a million more Californians who need it the most.  For families with kids under the age of six, they’ll see their benefit go up by as much as three times."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"But, in an economy where the world of work is in a perpetual state of flu, where workers are too often displaced, devalued and disconnected from the social safety net, we must also think bigger."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,It’s time to develop a new modern compact for California’s changing workforce. This is much bigger than Dynamex.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"California needs a comprehensive statewide strategy to uplift and upskill our workers, to ensure technological advancements in AI, blockchain, big data, are creating jobs, not destroying them, and to reform our institutions so that more workers have an ownership stake in their sweat equity."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,We will appoint a new Commission on California’s Workforce & Future of Work. We will bring together leaders from labor and business – both the public and private sectors. Their assignment is to come up with new ideas to expand worker opportunity without extinguishing innovation or flexibility.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"California is proud to be home to technology companies determined to change the world. But companies that make billions of dollars collecting, curating and monetizing our personal data have a duty to protect it. Consumers have a right to know and control how their data is being used."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I applaud this legislature for passing the first-in-the-nation digital privacy law last year.  But California’s consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data. And so I’ve asked my team to develop a proposal for a new Data Dividend for Californians, because we recognize that your data has value and it belongs to you."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Now, we’ve covered a lot of ground today, but there is so much more that deserves our focus. Climate change.  Reforming our tax code and our criminal justice system. Major initiatives like paid family leave, universal pre-school, free community college, re-imagining the DMV…there’s so much more. And I’ll be talking a lot about those issues in the coming months."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"At my inauguration, I quoted the Sermon on the Mount about a house that did not fall in the face of floods and storms, because it was founded upon a rock."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"I promised that, together, “We will build one house for one California.”"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"We’ve started drawing the blueprint for that house, and together we will finish it."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,This goes deeper than budget numbers or program details. This is about the bonds between us as human beings.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"As St. Paul said, “we are many parts but one body.” We are all diminished when one of us struggles to lead a good life."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"The problems we face are as hard as they come, and decades in the making. But I truly believe we have the tools to solve them.  We have the technology and the know-how."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Most importantly, we have the generosity of our people."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Remember the story of the registered nurse in Paradise who was sitting in traffic, trying to escape the fire, as flames started to engulf his car. He thought, “this is it.” He recorded a goodbye video for his family. Then a miracle occurred: a bulldozer cleared burning cars out of his path. At that point, he could have driven away as fast as possible. That’s what a lot of people would have done."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Instead, he turned his car around and drove straight to the hospital in the middle of town, where he worked in the ICU.  He and his colleagues started treating injured people.  Then the hospital caught fire. They moved patients to a helipad 100 yards away as fast as they could."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,Every single one of them was safely evacuated.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"When he was asked why he did this – why he drove back through the fire when he could have saved himself – he shrugged and said, “This is what we do.”"
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,His name is Allyn Pierce and he’s here with us today.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Allyn is right. Taking care of each other, showing courage when it matters most – this is what we do in California."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,"Yes, we have so much left to do."
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,But I believe in the remarkable talent assembled here.
California,Gavin Newsome,Democrat,I believe in our state. And I know that the best is yet to come.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"As we confront historic social and technological change throughout our country and our state, let me start by saying what an honor it is to serve as Colorado’s 43rd Governor."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Before I deliver the state of the state, I’d like to deliver a message to every kid in Colorado. In our state, you can do anything you can dream. Here in Colorado, we celebrate our differences, embrace our uniqueness, and believe that what you look like and who you love matters less than what you ARE like and what you do for your community. Be proud of who you are, because your future is FULL of opportunity."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"To all the new members of the Legislature, welcome."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"To all the returning members of the Legislature, thank you."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And a special shout-out to the record-setting number of women who are now serving in this building.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"It’s only fitting that the very first state to elect any women TO its State House is now leading the way with a majority of women IN its State House. From Clara Cressingham, Carrie Holly, and Frances Klock, to Pat Schroeder, Polly Baca, Brianna Titone and every other trailblazing woman in this chamber today — Colorado’s barrier-breaking legacy is something we should all be proud of."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"President Garcia,"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Speaker Becker,"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Leader Holbert,"

Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Denver Mayor Hancock,"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Members of the Cabinet,"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"My staff,"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,First Gentleman Marlon Reis:
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Thank you all for being here.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Thank you all for your support and good wishes over the past few days.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And thank you for all that you have done and all that you will do for Colorado.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Years ago I sat over there with the State Board of Education and I never thought I’d be up here like this, but hey, this is Colorado!"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I hope you will all join me in thanking Colorado’s military members serving with honor across the globe, the National Guard troops who keep us safe, and the Colorado first responders who save lives in our communities day after day."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We are grateful for your service.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I would also like to specifically acknowledge Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Chairman Cuthair and Southern Ute Indian Tribe Councilman Red who are here today. Dianne and I are eager to work with both of you in the years ahead, and to continue strengthening our government-to-government relationships."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I stand here today with the big shoes of Governor Hickenlooper to fill. But, rest assured, I’ve got my blue sneakers on and I’m ready to keep us moving forward."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And I stand here incredibly proud to have Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera, a healthcare leader, a former legislator, and one of the toughest people on the planet, working with me to help shape Colorado’s future."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,The state of our state is solid. It is strong. It is successful. It is daring. And it is bold.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"While my predecessor and this Legislature should get credit for so much of Colorado’s progress, our strength lies first and foremost in the bold and pioneering spirit of our people."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Here in Colorado, we climb the highest mountains. We look far past the horizons. We dream, we dare, and we do."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,That spirit has been alive and well under the leadership of Governor Hickenlooper as we overcame tough economic times to build one of the strongest state economies in American history.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,But I’m not here just to talk about the current state of the state and all the incredible achievements of the past few years.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,I’m here to talk about the state of what’s yet to come.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Because in the days, months, and years ahead, we are here to do more than build on the achievements of the past..."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We are here to boldly forge a new path into the future. To make change work for us, rather than against us."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"It’s true that our economy is strong. From agriculture and outdoor recreation to aerospace, bioscience, energy, and cannabis, we’ve watched industries succeed and create jobs."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We’ve become a model for how we can put politics aside and work together.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"But, despite all of our progress, far too many people are either barely getting by, or falling behind."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Our administration's mission and mandate from the voters begins with tackling the everyday challenges that Coloradans face because of the rising costs of living...
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Providing every single child with quality early education;
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Finally lowering the outrageous cost of health care;
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Creating good-paying jobs in the clean-energy sector that can never be outsourced; and
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Achieving true tax reform that reduces taxes for hardworking Coloradans instead of giving breaks to special interests while forcing families to pay more.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Together, we’re going to build an economy where Coloradans from all walks of life don’t just get by, but thrive..."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Whether it’s the small business owner in Eagle County whose health care costs are threatening their Colorado dream…
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,The rancher in Fort Morgan whose livelihood is threatened by drought...
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Or the parents struggling to pay $400 a month for kindergarten tuition in Douglas County.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"To these Coloradans across our state, I want to say: our administration will work tirelessly to make our state work better for you — so that you can earn a good living and share in our special way of life. And I know that this Legislature will do the same, because every single one of us wants to see every single Coloradoan succeed. A Colorado for all."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Part of what defines our Colorado way of life are the values that we live by — values like equality under the law, honesty, the sanctity of basic human rights, and a free market for exchange of goods and services. We see the erosion of these values in some quarters of our nation today — which makes them all the more precious."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Here in Colorado, we treat each other with respect. We reject efforts to intimidate immigrant families, or tear children from their parents’ arms. We don’t tolerate bigotry or discrimination of any kind. And we don’t accept hostage-taking as a form of governance."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Last summer, Marlon and I were having a conversation with our son Caspian, who was 6 at the time. He wanted to know the difference between all the various political parties — Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green, and so on. And at the end, he went over to his 4-year-old sister Cora and asked her, “What political party are you in?” And without missing a beat she answered, “the Happy Birthday Party.”"
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"It was one of those moments every parent experiences, where your child shows you wisdom you can’t get from most adults. And it’s wisdom that will guide our approach to problem-solving in this administration."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Because what truly matters is not the letter next to our name or which side of the aisle we sit on. What matters is: will our ideas be good for Colorado? Will they reduce health care costs? Will they improve our schools and help our kids get a strong start? Will they expand economic opportunity to more Colorado families?
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"This doesn’t mean any of us should abandon our values. What it does mean is that mere partisanship will never stop us from embracing good ideas or taking bold action. The people of Colorado elected each of us to deliver, not to grandstand."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"So, in the spirit of putting problem-solving over partisanship, let’s work together."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We all agree that every child deserves a great education, so let’s start there."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"If we want Colorado to be a place where every person can build a great life for themselves, where our economy can continue to grow fueled by a skilled workforce, then our schools need to provide students with the tools they need to succeed."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,One of the great joys of my life was starting the New America School and the Academy of Urban Learning — public charter schools for at-risk youth — and seeing how kids who had fallen through the cracks in our education system could take off and go on to achieve amazing things once they were given the opportunity.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,It’s time for us to build a Colorado education system where every single child — regardless of their zip code — gets a great education that prepares them for a bright future. And it begins with preschool and kindergarten.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Our top priority this session is empowering every single Colorado community to offer free, full-day kindergarten, while expanding free preschool to 8,000 more Colorado children."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Our state’s strong economic growth means we have the power to do all of this right now without taking resources away from other areas of the budget. As Uncle Ben once said to Spiderman, “With great power comes great responsibility.” I know that together we can fulfill this responsibility, which many of you have been working on for years: Free Kindergarten Now."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Making full-day kindergarten available and accessible for all children sets kids up to be more successful in school and throughout their lives — improving performance, narrowing achievement gaps, leading to earlier identification and intervention for those with special needs, even increasing high school graduation rates down the road."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And all of us will share in those benefits. It will save taxpayer money in the long run by increasing incomes and decreasing the achievement gap. It will strengthen families, our communities, and our economy."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"But today, the state only funds half-day kindergarten, leaving individual districts and parents holding the bag for the rest. And it is not cheap. Most districts charge tuition to pay for the extra half day. Some offer it free to students, but only by cutting funding for other priorities like teacher salaries or class size."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"As a result, kindergarten in Colorado is a picture of inequality, where some students attend free full-day kindergarten, some must pay tuition, and other families get left behind because they cannot afford the cost."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"In Colorado, families can pay upwards of $500 per month to enroll their kids in full-day kindergarten. That’s money that can instead go toward a good home, health care, a college fund, retirement savings, starting a small business, or simply a nice vacation once in a while."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Folks, Oklahoma figured all this out a long time ago. And with all due respect to our wonderful neighbors in the Sooner state, if they can do it, so can we."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"What we are proposing is the single biggest expansion of early childhood education in Colorado history. It is an essential first step in our broader strategies for both early childhood and K-12 education, setting kids up for success right from the start. In fact, it will free up resources to get closer to an even more ambitious goal: full-day preschool available for every Colorado child, which the families of this state deserve, and which we are committed to achieving."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And I want to be clear: this is not a mandate, either for parents or for school districts. But for parents who believe public preschool and full-day kindergarten are the best option for their kids — and for school districts who want to offer these vital opportunities to families — we will do everything possible to make it happen."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"School districts, education nonprofits, and bipartisan state legislators have done amazing work to raise public awareness of the benefits of full-day kindergarten and make it a top priority in this state."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Now it’s time for us to finally cross the finish line. Free, full-day kindergarten by fall of 2019. Let’s get it done."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Colorado has the fastest growing economy in the country. It’s time our students, families, and dedicated teachers started sharing in that success."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And here are three other areas we can make real progress on together, if we truly value our students — and their teachers."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"First, our educator shortage is having a devastating effect on public schools across this state. We’re 3,000 teachers down from where we need to be, and schools in rural communities are feeling the brunt of the impact."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We should offer student loan relief for teachers who serve in these high-need areas. It’ll enable more schools to make good on their potential to provide our children with the very best education. And it’ll help more hardworking educators afford daily life as indispensable members of the communities where they teach.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Every day, we entrust Colorado’s educators with our children’s safety, with helping them grow into successful, compassionate adults. Educators deserve our respect. They deserve our gratitude. And they deserve to be compensated as the hardworking professionals they are."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Second, more than 750,000 Coloradans are carrying over $19 billion dollars in student loan debt. We can lessen this burden by bringing more transparency to the student-loan process and providing basic consumer protection for borrowers."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And a third area where we can have a major impact is graduation rates. While we have made some progress over the past few years, Colorado still only ranks in the middle of all states with our graduation rate from high school."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Colorado’s Education Leadership Council has done admirable work shining a light on this problem and examining how it can be solved.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We need to invest in proven programs that prevent students from falling through the cracks, and work with local communities to provide students the support they need to succeed in high school and in life."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"This means recognizing that it is hard for a student to learn if they are hungry, homeless, or struggling with trauma or mental illness."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I know there are many thoughtful and innovative proposals here in the legislature to improve behavioral health resources in our schools. I look forward to working with you to help our most vulnerable students overcome the barriers they face through no fault of their own, and graduate from high school as healthy adults."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"In the 21st century economy, a high school degree is more important than ever for economic success. If we are going to make sure students are prepared for careers in the booming areas of Colorado’s economy – fields like technology and renewable energy — then the first step is to look at innovative solutions for reducing dropout rates."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"When our students rise, our state rises even more."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Another top priority — one that we know has lit a fire under Americans here in our state and across this country — is health care. Governor Hickenlooper and this Legislature did admirable, bipartisan work expanding access to affordable health care in Colorado — overseeing the expansion of Medicaid, expanding access to vital reproductive health services, and cutting the uninsured rate to an unprecedented six-and-a-half percent."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"But despite all the progress we’ve made, health care costs are still rising today, and families are still being ripped off."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"It’s time for us to build a health care system where no person has to choose between losing their life savings and losing their life. It’s time for Coloradans to pay a fair price for the prescription drugs they need. It’s time for folks experiencing mental illness or addiction to get treatment, not jail time."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And we must work to make Colorado as family-friendly as possible. As a first step, with our budget package coming on the 15th, I will be including a formal request to provide paid parental leave for all state employees. And together, we should take comprehensive action. It’s time to finally establish a paid family and medical leave program in Colorado — so that employees aren’t having to choose between keeping their paycheck and caring for their child, a sick relative, an aging parent, or themselves."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Look, if all this were easy, it would have been done already. Progress is always hard, and overcoming these challenges will be a long journey. But the people of Colorado need and deserve nothing less, and our work begins now."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Another immediate step we’re taking is the creation of the first-ever Office of Saving People Money on Health Care.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We aren’t giving this office a fancy name to make it SOUND important. Instead we’re giving it a simple name because it IS important.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Led by Lieutenant Governor Primavera, The Office of Saving People Money on Health Care will form the beating heart of our efforts to reduce patient costs for hospital stays and expenses, improve price transparency, lower the price of prescription drugs, and make health insurance more affordable."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And let me say a bit about why Dianne is the very best person to take on this challenge.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Many of you in this chamber had the opportunity to serve with Dianne during her four terms in the State House, and you saw her at work as one of the fiercest, most knowledgeable patient advocates we’ve ever had."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"As a young woman raising her two young kids, Dianne was diagnosed with breast cancer and told she had less than five years to live. She knows firsthand how our healthcare system makes getting sick even harder by robbing people of their financial security at the same time they’re struggling to reclaim their health."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Dianne survived cancer, got well, worked hard for Colorado AND raised two amazing daughters who are here with us today."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"She dedicated her life to helping others get quality, affordable health care and we just couldn’t ask for anyone better to lead this administration’s health care efforts."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Dianne is a fighter and she is living proof that, with strength, courage, and resilience, we can overcome all obstacles and solve any challenge."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And as Dianne has said, health care is something that affects everyone, no matter our political beliefs. It is not a partisan issue."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We must work to get a grip on the opioid epidemic, which has taken thousands of lives, devastated our communities, and stretched our resources to the breaking point. In 2017 alone, more than 550 Coloradans died because they overdosed on either prescription or illicit opioids. I look forward to working with legislators from both parties on solutions that focus on both addiction prevention and access to effective treatment."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And we must tackle the outrageous health care costs facing Coloradans — particularly in rural and mountain counties. There’s no reason for anybody to lose their savings or their home simply trying to keep up with rising health care costs. And there is no reason a family in Glenwood Springs or Gunnison should pay twice as much for health care as a family in Denver.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We’ll empower the Division of Insurance to protect consumers and support rural and mountain communities working to lower their health care costs.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We’ll establish a reinsurance program to reduce costs and save Coloradans money. This is a proven solution to reduce health care costs that has worked in other states, and it’s one we should embrace in Colorado."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And finally, we will address the appalling costs of prescription drugs. Canada has the same drugs from the same manufacturing plants that we have here in the United States — but often at one-half, one-third, yes, even one-quarter of the cost."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Together with the Legislature, I look forward to setting up a way for Colorado to safely import prescription drugs from Canada. The burden that prescription drug costs place on families is simply too crushing for us not to act boldly."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Our ultimate objective is to bring universal, high-quality, affordable care to every Colorado family. We know that won’t happen overnight, but the work we will do together in this legislative session will put us on the right path and bring us closer to our goal."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Together we can save Coloradans money, help small businesses across the state, and clear away barriers that prevent Coloradans from receiving needed life-saving health care."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Now, I want to say something that I know has total and complete bipartisan agreement in this room: Colorado is the best state in the nation, and frankly, it isn’t even close."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,It’s our job to keep it that way.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Here in Colorado, we pride ourselves on our unbeatable quality of life and the breathtaking beauty of the state we proudly call home. Protecting our special way of life for ourselves and future generations is one of the most sacred responsibilities we all share."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Not only do our majestic mountains and plains provide endless opportunities to enjoy our natural world with friends and family and to find solitude — they also are vital to our economic success.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Colorado is now proudly the home of the Outdoor Retailer Show, a testament to our collective commitment to public lands and the outdoor recreation economy. We will continue to defend our public lands, promote access to outdoor recreation, and stand up for the outdoor industry’s 230,000 and growing Colorado jobs."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"While the outdoor recreation economy continues to expand opportunities in rural Colorado, we must also double down on supporting Colorado’s rich farming and ranching tradition."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Though our agriculture exports have nearly quadrupled over the last two decades, the last few years have been difficult for farmers and ranchers. Volatile commodities markets, a damaging trade war from Washington, an increasingly serious water shortage — are all making life harder for the men and women of our agriculture industry."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We need to make sure today’s farmers and ranchers, and tomorrow’s, have the tools to succeed. And I couldn’t be more excited that our nominee for Agriculture Commissioner, Kate Greenberg, will be the first woman to hold the position. Kate has spent her career focused on the future of farming rather than the past, which is exactly what today’s challenges call for."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"The lifeblood of our agriculture industry is water — which is why we must commit to a bipartisan and sustainable funding source for the Colorado Water Plan. Governor Hickenlooper, along with the leadership of John Stulp, did extraordinary work bringing together a coalition of Coloradans from all corners of our state to create the Water Plan. Now we’re going to do our part by implementing it."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We will also partner with organizations like the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union’s Co-Op Development Center and others to reduce barriers to employee ownership and grow wages in the agriculture sector. And we’ll work with the Rural Colorado Venture Capital Fund to expand access to capital and help the next generation of farmers thrive.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And we’ll make good on the promise of industrial hemp. With our world-class universities like Colorado State and Adams State, which are at the forefront of hemp innovation, and with the leading hemp manufacturers and cultivators already here, we will seize the opportunity to make Colorado the national leader in industrial hemp production."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And when we talk about protecting Colorado’s way of life, we need to talk about climate change."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Climate change is a scientific reality. It’s real. There’s no pretending otherwise for farmers and ranchers who are facing historic water shortages. There’s no pretending otherwise for the 46,000 women and men who work in Colorado’s ski industry and see their jobs threatened by decreased snowpack."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And there will be no pretending otherwise in this administration. We’re going to confront this challenge head-on — not only because we must, but because we want to take advantage of the huge opportunities associated with being a leader in the growing green-energy economy."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I launched my campaign for Governor in Pueblo at an all-solar coffee-roasting small business, just 10 miles from the Vestas Wind Turbine factory, which employs 800 Coloradans today."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"I did so to demonstrate that our commitment to reaching 100% renewable energy by 2040 is not just about climate change. It’s about saving money for consumers with cheaper energy, and it’s about making sure the good-paying green jobs of the future are created right here in Colorado."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Today the work begins setting Colorado on course to reach that goal.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,That means modernizing both our grid infrastructure and our regulatory processes to ensure all Coloradans are reaping the full suite of benefits associated with swift adoption of renewable energy.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,It means working to electrify our cars and buses and trucks.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And it means taking advantage of modern technology to use energy more efficiently — cleaning our air and saving consumers money in the process.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"As Governor, my goal is to lead the statewide transition to a clean, sustainable, and growing economy. It is imperative for our climate, our security, our health, and our economic growth for all Coloradans."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We will lead with policies that support, enable, and accelerate market investment. We will work with stakeholders across Colorado on outcomes-based approaches that promote innovation, and that deliver emissions reductions from all sources, reductions in consumer costs, and sustainable economic growth for communities across Colorado."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We will build upon significant work and commitment by communities, businesses, and people throughout the state. Today 62,800 people are employed in advanced energy in Colorado. Xcel Energy has committed to achieving 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Communities like Pueblo, Summit County, Fort Collins, Denver and others across the state have embraced strong climate goals. We are already leading the way forward right here in Colorado, and now we will build on that progress."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Make no mistake — with price declines and technology advances, the move toward renewable energy is already taking place and will only accelerate. But as we embrace the renewable-energy future, we must also do right by all the men and women in today’s energy workforce. Some of the hardest-working people in Colorado today work in the coal and oil-and-gas industries and we will not leave them behind."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We will embrace the skills and experience these Coloradans bring to the table. Their help will be needed and rewarded at every single step of this transition. And we will support the communities these jobs have sustained, to ensure they can continue to thrive in the renewable-energy economy."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Creative financing mechanisms that exist today can ensure that consumers pay lower rates as we move to renewables, and help provide for a transition that is just and fair both for workers and for communities directly impacted."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Colorado has always been, and must always be, a place where we respect the dignity of hard work. Providing for ourselves and our families is at the core of the Colorado Way of Life we all love. And a strong economy cannot be built on any one sector, or any one region of the state, on its own."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Our mission is to help businesses of all kinds start, grow, thrive, and create good-paying jobs across Colorado, from the Western Slope and the Eastern Plains, to the Front Range, Southern Colorado, and the San Luis Valley."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We will value every job. We will respect every worker and every shareholder. We will protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for the pay and benefits they deserve, and the rights of shareholders to lead their companies."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"And just as we stand up for workers and good jobs, so too must we stand up for our communities — and their right to have a voice when it comes to industrial activities within their borders. It’s time for us to take meaningful action to address the conflicts between oil-and-gas drilling operations and the neighborhoods they impact, and to make sure that all of our communities have clean air and water."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,This is a vital quality-of-life issue for Colorado families.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"To keep our economy moving in the right direction, we must upgrade our antiquated roads and highways and limited public transit options. They are simply not equipped to sustain a growing 21st-century economy."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Thanks to the bipartisan commitment made last year to dedicate additional funds to transportation, we have hundreds of millions of dollars to improve our roads over the next few years."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,That’s a strong foundation to work from but it’s not enough. We must come together around a bipartisan funding mechanism for our future transportation needs that the voters of this state will accept.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"We also need to expand access to broadband. I’m eager to work with legislators to cut red tape that forces communities to go through costly and lengthy elections to build out their own broadband infrastructure. And at the same time, we’ll continue the good work of the Hickenlooper administration in supporting the creation of Strategic Regional Broadband plans to make high-speed internet access a reality across our entire state."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"In the 21st-century economy, broadband is critical infrastructure that EVERYONE must have access to. Let’s work together to give it to them."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"So many of the important issues Coloradans face today boil down to opportunity. The opportunity to grow and start a business. The opportunity to enjoy Colorado’s special way of life, our majestic outdoors. The opportunity to get a great education that leads to a successful future."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"But for Colorado to be a place where these opportunities are available for all, and not just some, we need to make our economy work better for middle-class families."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"One way we’ll do this is by working with you to make our tax code more fair, so that we can reduce rates for Colorado families and small businesses. Our tax code gives too much power to the special interests who can afford expensive lobbyists, while forcing ordinary families to pay more. As legislators, I know that many of you find these tax giveaways offensive."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Unlike budget expenditures, which you vote on every year, these tax expenditures are on autopilot, some since the 1930s. We need a tax code that reflects today’s realities rather than yesterday’s distortions. Let people keep more of their hard-earned money rather than give it away to special interests."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"The Legislature and the Auditor, thanks to your efforts, have gotten off to a good start by closely examining which deductions are benefiting our economy, and which are being exploited by corporations at Coloradans’ expense. I want to work with you to close these loopholes and pass the savings on to families by lowering the income tax rate."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"For instance, many of the changes in President Trump’s tax law were giveaways to the most influential corporations in the country. Some big businesses pay less, while many families here in Colorado have to pay more. We should not blindly copy President Trump’s policies into our state tax code. We do not need to take the bad with the good. Instead, we should reflect the good in our tax code and change the bad to put families and small businesses ahead of special interests as nearly every other state has done."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Also, 90 percent of the retailers in our state are small businesses. It's time to cap the vendor fee, which is a giveaway to the largest and most profitable retailers in the nation, and use the savings to lower rates, which will benefit small businesses and millions of working Coloradans."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"That’s extra money Colorado families can use on home repairs, a college fund, or any of the other innumerable expenses that folks are having a harder and harder time keeping up with as the cost of living keeps going up."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,We want to make Colorado better for everyone. Broadening the base while lowering rates leads to more growth and a stronger economy. We look forward to working with you to seek tax efficiencies and clear-eyed policies that make everyone better off.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Our tax reform proposal will not change how much money the state collects or affect investment in public priorities one way or the other. It simply asks the largest, most influential corporations to start paying their fair share so that individuals, families, and small businesses can pay less."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"As we address the inequities in our tax code, so too must we address the inequities in our criminal justice system. That means tackling discriminatory practices that make people of color, individuals living with mental illness, and Coloradans experiencing poverty more likely to face incarceration. And it means working to make sure Coloradans who do serve prison or jail time are able to live a dignified and fulfilling life after they’ve paid their debt to society."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Criminal justice reform is an economic necessity and a human-rights necessity. We won’t follow on this issue. We’ll lead.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"It’s not easy folks, but it is simple: every Coloradan wants the opportunity to earn a good life. And we can break down the barriers that hold them back by bringing high-quality early education to every family, lowering health care costs, creating good-paying jobs here, and saving families money on their tax bill."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"What makes Colorado unique isn’t just the boldness of our ideas. It is the resilience and the spirit of our people, who make change happen, who bring these bold ideas to life."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Our shared responsibility is to turn challenges into opportunities and ideas into action.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"So, now is the time to unite in our common purpose and move Colorado forward."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,"Together, we will build a Colorado that works for ALL."
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,Let’s get to work. God bless you.
Colorado,Jared Polis,Democrat,And God bless the great state of Colorado.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Senator Fasano, Representative Klarides, my fellow state officials, members of the General Assembly and the Judicial Branch, Lt. Governor Bysiewicz, honored guests and the people of the great State of Connecticut."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Thank you for welcoming me to the room where it happens.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"I am especially proud to be here with my family, Annie, Emily, Lindsay and Teddy – sometimes it gets pretty feisty at the Lamont dinner table, we are not shy. But at the end of the day we are family. I feel the same about the State of Connecticut."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,To Dan Malloy: Many thanks for your decades of public service and leadership to our state.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"And to Nancy Wyman, we’re going to keep you busy, that’s for sure."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"I see my friend George Jepsen in the front row – you will be right across the street, so I know where to find you."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Because we are just getting started.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"A few weeks ago, Susan and I joined a couple thousand Connecticut high school students at the Bushnell for a performance of Hamilton. Before the curtain went up, we discussed with the students the meaning of my favorite song, “My Shot” sung by a young Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant teenager from the Caribbean, “young, scrappy and hungry” like the nation he is joining – and how he is not going to throw away his shot."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"What I love about America is that in every generation we get a chance to reinvent ourselves, and every election gives us a fresh start. This is our chance to reinvent Connecticut, to think big and act boldly."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,And it starts right here in the room where it happens.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,The Connecticut We Once Were
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Connecticut has always been the state where it happens.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Connecticut is inventive:
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"We shaped the defense industry with the invention of the world’s first submarine in Old Saybrook, and then reinvented it with the world’s first nuclear submarine in Groton."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,We revolutionized multiple industries through the invention of rubber that could withstand both heat and cold in Naugatuck.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,We redefined the workplace with the invention of the portable typewriter in Stamford.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,The world’s first helicopter was designed and piloted by Igor Sikorsky right here in Stratford.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"A century later, Sikorsky’s factory is still here and Electric Boat remains the largest submarine manufacturer in the world, and they are two of Connecticut’s largest employers – a proud piece of Connecticut’s history."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"But over the last generation, Connecticut’s entrepreneurial zip has slipped. We are no longer a place that is viewed as hospitable or encouraging to new businesses."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Connecticut, it’s time to return to our inventive and entrepreneurial roots. Our future lies in doubling down on what makes us great and reimagining our unique potential. And it starts with the best educated workforce in the world."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"I always made it a point to visit our schools, because it was important to me to keep my eye on the future."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"My first stop in Bridgeport was Harding High, where I helped out many years ago, and whose band just lead our parade to the State Capitol. Their old high school was pretty beat up, but you should have seen the excitement in the eyes of the students, and their parents and teachers, on opening day at the new Harding High. The custodians told me something interesting – the old Harding was a mess at the end of the day, but the new Harding was still pretty neat by day’s end."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"In showing the students that we believed in them, they showed pride in themselves, and their school."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"I saw the same optimism and pride at the new Career Academy in Waterbury, where nearly 98 percent of the students graduate. Many of these students go on to great colleges, but many go on to apprenticeships in healthcare and advanced manufacturing. These are Connecticut jobs for Connecticut students."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,And I saw that same sense of optimism in the eyes of the students that I taught at Central Connecticut State University for 12 years.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"My favorite day during the campaign was at UConn, where we saw three Blackhawk helicopters flying low overhead. We all ran to check out the action and saw the choppers landing at the School of Engineering. It was a Sikorsky job recruitment drive, encouraging Connecticut students to start their career right here in the state."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"None of this would be possible, without the dedication and devotion of Connecticut’s teachers – the finest in the country."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Connecticut – we do not have silicon, we don’t have natural gas, but we have always had the best educated, best trained, most productive, most inventive workforce in the world. That is our strategic advantage and it is more important in the 21st century than ever before."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Companies roam the globe looking for talent. Look no further, you can stop right here."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,The Connecticut We Can Be Again
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Let’s Fix this Budget Once and For All
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"So at this point, you’re probably thinking, “That’s all well and good, gov. But the budget is a mess.”"
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,How can we be a laboratory of democracy when we have such a hard time paying our bills?
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"We cannot afford to let the next four years be defined by a fiscal crisis. The fate of our great state is on a knife’s edge. If we choose inaction and more of the same – we fail. But if we choose creative and bold leadership, a commitment to make the hard and difficult choices necessary to right the wrongs of the past – we will succeed."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Let’s fix this damn budget, once and for all!"
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"In six weeks, I will present to you a budget which is in balance not just for a year, but for the foreseeable future; so that mayors and first selectmen, business and labor leaders, teachers and police officers know what to expect. And we will deliver on what we say – on time and on budget."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"However, I want to be clear – no more funny math or budgetary gamesmanship. I come from the world of small business where the numbers have to add up at the end of the month or the lights go out."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Don’t tell me some consultant says there are $1 billion in easy spending cuts; show me the money or I will show you the door.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Unlike in DC, our government doesn’t shut down – we don’t play those games here. We can’t tell students school is closed today, police or fire departments can’t say we’ll respond later, and we don’t tell our most vulnerable that the services they depend upon will reopen at a later date."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Lastly, I refuse to invest any time in the blame game of who’s responsible for this crisis. It’s real, it’s here and it’s time to confront it head on."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"And, please don’t tell me you’ve done your share and it’s somebody else’s turn. It’s all of our turns."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Fix the budget, invest in the future, and nothing can stop us."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,A Bigger Table and an Open Door
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Fixing the budget requires a bigger table and an open door. I am ready to listen to any good idea, and I will take the heat and share the credit. The budget vote will be a tough one, no doubt. It will be easy to vote no, but I have a responsibility to get us to yes - and we only get there by working together."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Business leaders: Some of you have already stepped up and are ready to take the lead when it comes to workforce development and positioning Connecticut students to take Connecticut jobs. A special thanks to my Business Advisory Council, which is already reaching out to new companies that may be a great fit for Connecticut."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Philanthropic leaders and volunteers: Giving back is the highest form of citizenship. I am excited about your willingness to partner with us to invest in our future. I am confident we will do great things together.
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"State employees and labor leaders: I have been so impressed by the quality of the folks who work for the State of Connecticut. I am a strong believer in labor, and now is the time to show that collective bargaining works in tough times, as well as good times. As our liabilities continue to grow faster than our assets, together we have to make the changes necessary to ensure that retirement security is a reality for our younger, as well as our older, state employees, and do that without breaking the bank."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Mayors and first selectmen: Nothing will compromise your feisty independence, but so many services and back-office functions can be delivered at a much lower cost and much more efficiently if they are operated on a shared or regional basis. We need to break down silos and engage in the bulk purchasing of everything from healthcare to technology. The taxpayers of Connecticut can no longer afford to subsidize inefficiency."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Economic Revitalization
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Connecticut is the land of steady habits, and while we need to return to the habits which made us such an economic powerhouse a generation ago, we also need to change the game – and create new habits, that capitalize on our strengths."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Our great state is strategically positioned between two super-cities. Connecticut needs to harness its prime location, its highly educated workforce, and its business community to create the Connecticut of tomorrow."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"To achieve this, I will be focusing on four areas:"
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"First, I will take the lead by investing in the first all-digital government, and reverse engineer every transaction from the taxpayer’s shoes. The entry point to Connecticut will be through its digital front door, a one-stop-shop for everything current and prospective citizens need from their government. We will be online, not in line. It won’t be done overnight, but let’s start today."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Second, to attract millennials, top talent and leading companies, Connecticut will need to invest wisely in its urban centers – making them affordable and lively, where families want to live, work and play. That means great schools, safe streets and by making our cities the first with 5G in New England. The telecommunication companies are ready to start building – let’s harness that excitement, and get WiFi access into every rural town."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Third, none of this is possible if we don’t have a 21st century transportation system. When the Merritt Parkway opened in 1940, it wasn’t uncommon for people to pull over and picnic on the side of the road. Those of us who spend a good deal of time down in Fairfield County have contemplated the same idea today because we’re so darn frustrated by bumper-to-bumper traffic. Gridlock causes headaches and costs us jobs."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"So what can we do? 30/30/30 – I want the following to be a reality: 30 minutes from Hartford to New Haven; 30 minutes from New Haven to Stamford; and 30 minutes from Stamford to Manhattan with spurs to New London and Waterbury. This isn’t a pipedream, this is a necessity: a modern infrastructure by rail, road, air and water – to unlock the full economic potential of our beautiful state."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Fourth, Connecticut’s economic revival cannot only be about creating opportunities for just some of our people. It must be an economy that works for everyone. We must bring our workforce into the 21st century, closely aligning it with job training, starting with STEM and coding in K-12, and access to higher education, vo-tech and apprenticeships that will result in access to good paying Connecticut jobs."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"That also means bringing the workplace into the 21st century, including paid family leave to make sure that parents don’t have to choose between the child they love and the job they need. It also means a $15 dollar minimum wage, responsibly and over time, so that those same parents can afford to provide for their children without working three jobs."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"As one of the first Governors who comes from the business world, I will be hyper-focused on job creation. My primary objective is to get this economy growing again."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,How do we extend opportunity for those being left behind? Growth!
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,What’s the long-term fix to the budget? Growth!
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,How do we attract the next generation of talent to Connecticut? Growth!
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Now all of that economic growth takes time to nurture, but it starts today!"
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,Blueprint for the Future
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"I’m a new Governor, and you’re a new legislature. Even for those of you who have been here for a few years, this is a new day."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"What you can expect from me is the following: I’m a straight shooter, an honest broker and a good listener. I know what I know and I know what I don’t. I do have a strong sense of where we need to go and of what the people of Connecticut expect from us."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Last November, thousands of voters waited in the rain, in some cases, for hours to vote. They believed that we can make a difference; we will and we must."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Let’s work together and produce a budget for the people of Connecticut that doesn’t borrow from the future, but instead invests in the future."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"Like those kids at Harding High, who believed in themselves, I believe in Connecticut. You are here because you believe in our state. Let’s get Connecticut growing again."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"As they say in Hamilton, history has its eyes on you, on all of us. Let’s do this. Together."
Connecticut,Ned Lamont,Democrat,"May God bless you, and may God bless the hardworking people of this great state!"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Lt. Governor Hall – Long, Mister President Pro Tem, Mister Speaker, Members of the 150th General Assembly, Members of the Cabinet, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, invited guests, and my fellow Delawareans:"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Thank you for inviting me into the chamber today.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"I want to take a point of personal privilege here at the beginning. The Carney clan is a big one and is well – represented in the room today. My wife Tracey, my mom, Ann, my sister Liz and brother – in-law Brendan, my brothers Mike and Joe and my sister Claire. And a special thanks to the most famous Carney for making the trip down here today – my nephew Brian O’Neill, who just finished his rookie season as the starting right tackle for the Minnesota Vikings."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Before I start I want to recognize all of the new faces in the room, and there are many. This is an exciting year for Delaware, and for public service. Never before has our General Assembly better reflected the people of our state. We will all benefit from the new perspectives, and new ideas, here in our Legislature."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Senators Lockman, Brown and Sturgeon."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Representatives Chukwuocha, Seigfried, Kendra Johnson, Griffith, Cooke, Dorsey-Walker, Minor-Brown, Bush, Smith, Morris, Shupe, and Vanderwende."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,The class of 2018: Join me in welcoming them to Legislative Hall.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"As you criss-crossed your districts this past election, I know you heard the same thing I did."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Delawareans are tired of the fighting in Washington, D.C.  They’re tired of gridlock and negativity, and of politics as usual.  They want us – they’re asking us – to be different. To be better."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,They think it’s a “win” when we get something done. Not when we score political points.  They don’t want us to shut down the government.  They want us to make the government work for them.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Working hard, and working together, we can do this. We can make the people who sent us here proud of what we do. And they can be secure in the knowledge that their elected representatives are fighting for them, and not fighting for sport."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"So before I say anything else from this podium today, I want to say this. Here in Delaware,  we can do better, and we must do better. And I believe that working together these next six months, we will do better."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"When I ran for office in 2016, I promised that our number one priority would be to strengthen our economy to create good jobs for Delawareans.  And that we would focus on making Delaware a place where businesses would want to locate, and grow."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Over the past two years, and thanks in large part to the work of many of you, we have 10,000 new jobs in Delaware. Our unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent for the first time since 2008."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Working with you, we signed an agreement to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment to the Port of Wilmington, and dramatically expand Port operations. The deal will create hundreds, if not thousands, of new jobs. As our former Vice President would say, this is a big ** deal."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"This would not have been possible without an incredibly strong partnership with the workers at the Port, and the vision and leadership of people like Bill Ashe and Kimoko Harris, who are here in the chamber with us today. Bill and Kimoko, please stand up and be recognized."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We also passed the Angel Investor Tax Credit.  So we have new incentives to support investment in technology-focused small-businesses that want to create jobs here in Delaware.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"The Delaware Prosperity Partnership has done eight successful transactions, representing 1,900 jobs. And we’ve got many more potential deals in the pipeline."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Led by Representatives Osienski and Heffernan, we amended the Coastal Zone Act to open up 14 abandoned industrial sites that will create good-paying blue-collar jobs. The Delaware"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Prosperity Partnership is already marketing these Coastal Zone sites to developers.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We’re aggressively pursuing developers to take advantage of Opportunity Zones created by the new federal tax law. That could mean new jobs at the Nylon Capital Shopping Center in Seaford, the Star Campus at the University of Delaware in Newark, areas in Dover and Milford, and the old steel mill in Claymont."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,The Downtown Development District program has supported projects like the Stitch House
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Brewery and the Midtown apartment complex in Wilmington, and the House of Coffi just around the corner here in downtown Dover."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"In the coming weeks, we’ll expand this program to more towns across our state. We’ll also"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,direct more funding to the Housing Development Fund and the Strong Neighborhoods Housing Fund.  These programs will help lift up distressed neighborhoods and communities across our state.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"By the end of next year, we’ve pledged to eliminate broadband deserts in southern Delaware, and provide universal high-speed internet coverage for all Delawareans and businesses."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We’re investing in Delaware State University, Delaware Tech, and the University of Delaware,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,so that we can meet the workforce needs of future employers.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,And we continue to make historic investments in our infrastructure – with over $3 billion to
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"upgrade our transportation system through 2025.  That means less traffic, safer bridges, and"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,more pedestrian friendly streets.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"This year, I’m proposing to create a new Transportation Infrastructure Investment Fund that"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,would help the state to react quickly to important economic development projects.  We’re going to invest $10 million in this new fund.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It’s an investment in the jobs of tomorrow.  But I hope you’ll join me in funding these investments today!
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Together, we have done good work these past two years. And I’m confident to report today that the state of our state is strong, and getting stronger."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"A strong economy means more jobs, and more tax revenue, which means more money to educate our children. Improve our quality of life. And keep our communities safe."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"But while a rising tide lifts a lot of boats, there are too many in our state who have not benefited from the economic recovery.  These are the people who need our help the most."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,So let’s help them.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We’ll start with the most important investments we can make:  in our children.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"All parents want to see their children succeed. But in Delaware today, we have too many"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,children who are not thriving.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Despite the best efforts of dedicated teachers, principals and many others, it’s no secret that we are not seeing the student achievement in math and reading that we should.  All across the state, we know that many of our children are not getting the education they need to be successful in today’s world."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We also know that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need additional resources — resources they aren’t getting now.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"The status quo isn’t working, and we can’t let it continue."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Our goals are very clear.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Every third grader should be reading at grade level.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Every 8th grader should be proficient in math.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"And every student should be graduating high school ready for college, or a career."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It’s time to begin a new chapter in Delaware’s public education.  And here’s how we’ll do it:
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"With a focus on early childhood education, supporting teachers, and getting children to perform on grade level."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We all know that the earlier we can reach children, the better their chances of success. We’ve"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,heard from many of you about the need to strengthen our early education system.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"And so over the next year my administration will work with educators and stakeholders to take a hard look at how we prepare our youngest learners for kindergarten. In the meantime, I plan to recommend increasing Purchase of Care rates so that low-income parents have access to the best childcare centers in our state."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We will also continue to target additional resources to our highest needs schools. In my budget, I will more than double the funding for student loan repayment for teachers in high needs schools.  Last year, that program provided student loan assistance for 200 teachers in over 100 schools.  Next year, we plan to reach 700 teachers."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"These initiatives are only part of the solution.  Last year, we worked with all of you to target"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"funding, for the first time in our state’s history, to schools serving the highest percentage of"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"disadvantaged students. This Opportunity Funding, as we called it, is making an impact in 46 schools across all three counties."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Next week, when I release my budget, I will propose a new Opportunity Funding program – Delaware’s first real weighted funding plan. It will direct $60 million over the next three years to low-income students, and English learners across our state."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"The funding will pay for the type of help disadvantaged students need: more reading and math supports, counselors, smaller class sizes, and after school programs."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Let me tell you how this will be different from efforts tried in the past.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Over the course of the next three years, the Department of Education will work with district and charter leaders to review plans for spending this new funding, and track the results for students."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We will also create a new statewide commission of community leaders. They’ll evaluate this
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"plan, track results, and shine a light on best practices. They’ll also recommend new steps that"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,will help our most disadvantaged students succeed.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We can all agree that we need to do something dramatic to help these students. But here’s what we can’t do.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We can’t just throw money at the problem.  Simply spending more is not a guaranteed solution.  We’ve seen what schools are doing right now to close achievement gaps and set  students on a path toward success.  From North Laurel Elementary to Fairview Elementary in Dover, to Etta J. Wilson in Newark, educators, school leaders, and communities are showing us what’s possible today."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Delaware is one of only a handful of states that doesn’t provide additional funding for
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,disadvantaged students.  I am prepared to invest in better education programs that actually
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,achieve real results for children at risk.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Join me in helping these children reach their potential and realize their dreams.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We also need to stay focused on the good work we’re already doing for students with disabilities, and I want to thank Senator Poore, Representative Williams and many others for their relentless advocacy on behalf of these children."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"While students across the state need our help, students in the city of Wilmington are especially vulnerable.  We’ll continue to work with the Christina School District to bring smaller class sizes, critical capital upgrades, an early learning center and parent supports to Christina’s Wilmington schools.  We know that many of these students have suffered trauma at home and in their communities, and struggle to get their basic needs met."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,I want to take a minute here to thank my wife Tracey for her work on behalf of these children.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"In partnership with the Family Services Cabinet Council, and with support from Casey Family"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Programs, Tracey has been leading an initiative called First Chance Delaware. First Chance has been a vehicle to convene our state’s leading experts to combat child hood hunger. To promote school readiness and grade-level reading. And to improve our recognition of, and response to, childhood trauma."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,The goal of those efforts is to give every child in Delaware a first chance to succeed.  That’s also why I signed an Executive Order requiring all state agencies to train their employees in trauma-informed care.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Thank you, Tracey, for your good work!"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Too many of our kids who don’t succeed end up as adults who struggle. And some end up
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"committing crimes. When that happens, it’s in everyone’s interest that we rehabilitate these"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"individuals, and send them back into the community stronger, and better prepared to contribute."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,That’s why I signed an Executive Order to help ex-offenders more successfully reenter their
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,communities.  We’re creating individualized plans for each inmate incarcerated in Delaware.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"The goal is to give them the drug treatment, education, and job skills they need to survive on the outside."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Bottom line is really quite simple: over 90 percent of inmates will eventually leave prison.  They’ll be standing next to you in line at the Wawa or at the Mall. We need to make sure they’re better off when they leave prison than when they got there in the first place.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,All this will help keep communities safe.  And that’s a basic requirement for attracting  businesses to our state. It’s also a minimum standard our constituents expect us to meet.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"That’s why this year, we provided schools with new resources to make them safer, and passed responsible gun safety legislation. This included the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act, led by Representative Bentz.  Our success was thanks in large part to a group of advocates – mothers and students – who made this their mission last year. I’ll ask Sarah Stowens and Meghan Walls from Moms Demand Action, and Wyatt Patterson, a student at Caesar Rodney High School, who are here with us today, to stand and be recognized for their work.  Thank you."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We have more work to do, though, to keep our communities safe. This year, working with"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Representative Mitchell and others, we’ll propose legislation to ban guns made by 3D printers,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"and so-called ghost guns, where you can get a gun with no serial number and no background"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,check.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"And I want to thank Senator McBride for pledging to put the assault weapons bill up for a full,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,open debate. It’s the right thing to do.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"In the city of Wilmington, we’re working closely with Mayor Purzycki and Chief Tracy to combat gun violence.  Through the Family Services Cabinet Council, we’re working to share data on populations most at risk of violence. And to target resources toward getting our most violent offenders to put down their guns."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We have the Delaware State Police and first responders throughout the state to thank for the
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,safety of our communities. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women of the Army and Air National Guard. They’re citizen soldiers who make enormous sacrifices to
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"keep us safe, here and around the world. I want to recognize my newly confirmed Adjutant General Mike Berry, and thank the Senate for confirming him yesterday."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Maintaining a good quality of life in our state is one of the most basic things we can do for the citizens we represent. In addition to keeping communities safe, that means protecting the natural heritage that makes Delaware such a great place to live, work, and raise a family."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,These are the things that attract a strong workforce to our state
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"As Governor, I get to spend a lot of time outdoors, touring the places that make our state special."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Over the past year, I kayaked the Broadkill River and hiked the Edward H. McCabe Preserve in"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Milton.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"I met with business owners at the beach along Rehoboth Avenue, and visited with oyster farmers at Delaware Cultured Seafood in Millsboro."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We opened the new Auburn Valley State Park in Yorklyn, and dedicated $20 million to the"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"preservation of open space and farmland across our state.  Since the program’s inception,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Delaware has preserved almost 125,000 acres of farmland. That’s approximately 25 percent of all farmland in the state. And that’s something we can all be proud of."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"And just in case all that doesn’t sound exciting enough, I’ve got gifts here for our Pro Temp and Speaker to help us spread the good word. We’ve got one for the rest of the legislature"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,on your way out of the chamber.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Our natural heritage matters to Delawareans.  It matters to visitors.  It matters to businesses looking to locate where there’s cool stuff to do, and to young people looking to move back home. And it matters to future generations."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"As we all know, protecting our natural heritage is not a partisan issue. Speaker Schwartzkopf,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Senator Hansen and Senator Lopez joined me in Rehoboth last summer as I signed legislation to ban drilling for oil and gas in state waters off Delaware’s coast.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"As a low-lying state, sea level rise and climate change pose an existential threat to our bay"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"and coastal communities. Despite Washington’s refusal to act, we’ve joined with 16 other states to form the U.S. Climate Alliance."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We’ve committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 to at least 26 percent below 2005 levels. And we’ve committed to accelerating policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,This issue is too important to the health of our economy and the natural beauty of our state to let Washington politics get in the way.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Each of the last two years, we’ve made a strong push for cleaner water, investing tens of millions of dollars to maintain this vital resource that’s important to all of us."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"There is nothing more fundamental to our quality of life as Americans than having access to the voting booth. Right now, Delaware lags behind in making it easy and convenient for people to exercise their right to vote. We’re going to change that."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Working with all of you, I want to sign into law legislation allowing early voting, and same day registration."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Yesterday, led by Representative Longhurst and Senator Hansen, you made history by adding an Equal Rights Amendment to our state constitution. We have here in the chamber Suzanne Moore, who represents the thousands of women over the past four decades who have been"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,working for this cause. Help me thank them for their tireless work.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Part of having a good quality of life is making sure Delawareans can access and afford quality
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,healthcare. Delaware consistently spends more than most other states on healthcare costs.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Unfortunately, despite that high spending, Delawareans are not healthier than those in surrounding states. This all needs to change."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"That’s why I signed an executive order setting both quality and spending benchmarks for the entire healthcare system.  We’re doing this, first and foremost, by improving transparency around the cost of health care services.  We need to know what factors are driving these higher costs and how we can change the trends."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We know the health of our state begins with the health of our people. And that starts with tackling the most critical public health crisis we face — addiction and mental health. Too many families have personally experienced addiction and the tragic loss of loved ones.  Too often,"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"families don’t know where to turn to get the help and support they need. Last year in Delaware, nearly 345 people died from a drug overdose. That’s up 12 percent from the previous year. We all know someone who has been affected by this terrible crisis."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"The Behavioral Health Consortium, led by Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long, is taking action to"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,reduce mortality rates and improve access to treatment. That’s why we worked with
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Representative Bentz and Senator Townsend to create the nation’s first Overdose System of
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Care.  This past year, thanks in part to the work of the Behavioral Health Consortium, naloxone was administered over 3,000 times in Delaware, saving countless lives.  Through a peer-support initiative and better data-sharing, we’re doing more than ever to get the right treatment and support for the people who need it."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Living healthy lifestyles is probably the most important thing we can all do to lower healthcare
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,costs in the long run. We know that forming good health habits early in life increases the chances you’ll be a healthy adult. That’s why I intend to support Senator Townsend’s proposal to raise the age for purchasing cigarettes from 18 to 21.  Please join me in getting this done.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"This year, we made investments in our state employee workforce that were years overdue."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Two weeks after I was sworn in, a riot at James T. Vaughn prison took the life of Lieutenant Steven Floyd. Since that day, Commissioner Phelps and our team have spent every day trying to make sure that nothing like that ever happens again."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"This past summer, we concluded a year-long process of implementing the recommendations"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,of the Independent Review Team.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We hired outside experts to help us fix our prison healthcare system, and make the inmate grievance system more fair."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,We’ve revamped our recruitment efforts.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"We’ve raised pay for correctional officers and moved inmates out of state temporarily to give us time to hire more officers, reduce forced overtime, and make the prisons safer."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"This is an ongoing process. There’s no quick fix. But we are dedicated to the work, and to"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,making sure that Lieutenant Floyd did not die in vain.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Thanks to Senator McDowell and others, last year, state employees in every agency got a pay raise."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"And in my budget next week, I’ll propose that we continue these investments in state employee pay."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"I believe strongly in the importance of our state employees, and believe we need to continue to invest in them."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"I also believe strongly, though, that all of our spending, on state employees and throughout the state budget, needs to be sustainable. We all remember the painful task in 2017 of cutting our way out of a $400 million budget crisis."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"I don’t believe it does any good to spend money on ongoing expenses that we know we can’t pay for in the long-term.  That’s why, at the end of last session, I signed an Executive Order committing to a budget that limits our spending and creates a Budget Stabilization Fund to use in an economic downturn. We will follow these principles in the budget I propose next week. We will propose to use one-time money for one-time expenses, like infrastructure, nutrient management, water and wastewater treatment, and facilities for higher education. Making responsible budget decisions now will let us fund the services Delawareans rely on when money gets tight in the future, and we know it will."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Being fiscally responsible requires a long-term commitment to operating more efficiently and effectively. Many of you joined me in February 2017 at the launch of the Government Efficiency and Accountability Review–what we simply call GEAR.  Today, agencies and employees in every branch of government are working together on dozens of projects – reducing our leasing costs, launching online services, leveraging federal funding opportunities, and streamlining how we do business.  This year, with support from the Delaware Business Roundtable, we’ll offer monetary rewards to state employees who come up with and implement innovative, cost-saving initiatives."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Strengthening our Economy
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Improving our Schools for All Delaware Children
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Protecting our Quality of Life
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,These are priorities we can all agree on.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Over the next six months, there will be plenty to distract us from these priorities."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It’s our job to stay focused.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,That means making sure teachers have the resources they need to be successful.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure businesses have a climate where they can grow and create jobs.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure parents who are working can get affordable childcare.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure our roads are plowed so people can get to work.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure children can play in the park without fear of gun violence.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure correctional officers are safe when they report to work.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,It means making sure families can afford healthcare for their children.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Government can’t solve every problem, and we shouldn’t try. But we sure can make a real"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,difference in the lives of our friends and neighbors.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Working hard and working together, we can choose a path of progress and civility."
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Of hope and a better future.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,Of making the tough choices and doing what we were sent here to do.
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,"Thank you, God bless you, God bless the state of Delaware, and God bless our great United"
Delaware,John Carney,Democrat,States of America.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the House and Senate, Cabinet members and Supreme Court Justices:"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Mindful of the economic opportunities that lie before us,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"understanding the environmental challenges that require our attention,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"and conscious of our obligations to education and public safety,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I consider myself blessed to stand before you, at this particular moment in our history, as Florida’s 46th governor."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m grateful for your willingness to serve,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m proud of the accomplishments of our state and its citizens,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,and I’m optimistic that this legislative session provides us with a unique opportunity to advance needed reforms in a variety of different areas that will strengthen our state and benefit the people now and in the future.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Having spent three terms in a different legislature, a prison known as the US House of Representatives, it is quite a privilege to be able to work with a legislative body that has demonstrated the ability to get things done and to lead."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I’ve already seen it firsthand.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Two years ago, the Florida Legislature unanimously passed a resolution acknowledging and apologizing for the “gross injustices” perpetrated, in the middle of the last century, against four African-American men — Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shephard, and Ernest Thomas – known as the Groveland Four."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,The resolution requested that the Governor review their cases and issue pardons for these men.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Upon taking office in January, I took action.  Joined by our cabinet members, I approved pardons for all four men a few days into my term.  It’s never too late to do the right thing."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"In the gallery today is Carol Greenlee, the daughter of Charles Greenlee.  Her father passed away in 2012 but I hope he – as well as the rest of the Groveland Four — is looking down with some satisfaction that justice, however imperfect, eventually prevailed,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,that we here today are united in insisting that the constitutional protections central to a free society are honored for all of our citizens.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Members of the House and Senate, thank you for leading the way."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I observed during my inaugural address that, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, energy in the executive is the leading character in the definition of good government."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I believe it and I’ve worked to exemplify it.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"In less than 60 days, my administration has taken bold action to address issues that Floridians care about:"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,reorienting our environmental policy around the goal of cleaning up our water;
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,announcing far-reaching education reforms designed to make Florida #1 in skills-based education by 2030;
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,securing hundreds of millions of dollars for storm-ravaged parts of NW Florida;
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,bringing accountability to entities ranging from the Broward Sheriff’s Office to the South Florida Water Management District;
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,and appointing three spectacular justices to our Supreme Court.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,And this is just the beginning.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m proud to recognize the efforts of my wife Casey.  She has been by my side as we have toured the state and has also blazed her own trail on issues like education, disaster relief and freedom for the people of Venezuela.  She has worked so hard and one thing is clear: we have a great First Lady."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I’m convinced that this whole Governor thing is just a way for the people of Florida to have Casey as their First Lady.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,Our kids Madison and Mason have taken over the Governor’s mansion but the baby-proofing has been successful – I can report that no artifacts of Florida history have yet to be destroyed.  But stay tuned – Mason will be walking very soon.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Just last week, Casey traveled to NW Florida to survey the Hurricane Michael recovery efforts.  We have both been to the region several times over the past few months."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,To the people of NW Florida: we pledged to stand with you as you work to rebuild your communities stronger than before – and we have followed through on that pledge.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’ve already traveled to Washington, DC and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"My administration has worked to cut through red tape to expedite relief efforts and, thanks to the leadership of your former colleague Jared Moskowitz, we are making great progress."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Here with us today is Mayor Al Cathey and Administrator Tanya Castro from Mexico Beach, which was ground zero for Hurricane Michael’s wrath.  They and many others affected by the storm have displayed remarkable resilience in the face of huge obstacles.  They deserve our admiration – and our support."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"These communities will not be rebuilt in days, weeks or months, but they will be rebuilt.  They will be rebuilt because we as Floridians will answer the call as we always do.  God bless the good people of NW Florida.   Executive energy and leadership are necessary to meet fully the challenges that are before us – but they are not sufficient.  In a constitutional system with separated powers, we – the political branches – must work together so we can build off the foundation that has been laid and set the stage for the future success of our state."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,How can we accomplish this task?  I answer simply: be bold –
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"be bold in championing economic opportunity,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"be bold in protecting Florida’s environment,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"be bold in improving education,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"be bold in defending the safety of our communities,"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"be bold because while perfection is not attainable, if we aim high we can achieve excellence."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,ENVIRONMENT
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Florida is blessed with some of the nation’s finest natural resources.  We are the fishing and boating capital of the United States.  Our beaches bring millions of tourists to our state each and every year.  The state’s unique natural environment is central to our economy, our quality of life, and our identity as Floridians."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I’m proud to have taken swift and bold action to protect our natural resources and improve Florida’s water quality.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We are repositioning our water policy to meet the needs of our citizens, by, among other things:"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,expediting key projects like the EAA reservoir and raising the Tamiami Trail;
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"establishing a blue-green algae task force to develop policies to fight algae blooms, fight red tide and improve water quality; and"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,appointing a Chief Science Officer to better harness scientific data and research in service of Florida’s most pressing environmental needs.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’ve requested $2.5 billion over the next four years for water resources projects and Everglades restoration.  This represents a $1 billion increase compared to the previous four years and will allow us to bring major projects to completion.  Given the persistent water problems we have seen over the past several years, now is the time to be bold."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We cannot leave for tomorrow that which we can do today.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Because the people of Florida should have confidence that their interests are being reflected in policy implementation, I asked and received the resignations of all members on the South Florida Water Management District.  We needed a fresh start and I’m pleased to report that I’ve appointed a number of good people to this board."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We have a bold vision, we have good folks in key positions, and with your support for these initiatives, we will restore and preserve the beauty of Florida for generations to come."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,ECONOMY/JOBS
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,It is often said that states serve as laboratories of democracies and we are in the midst of a great experiment among the states regarding taxation and government spending.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"The result has been a migration of wealth from states that tax heavily, spend profligately, and regulate excessively to states, like Florida, that tax lightly, spend conservatively, and regulate reasonably."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"In the face of these trends, some of the states that have hemorrhaged businesses and taxpayers have decided to double down by raising existing taxes and imposing new taxes. As George Harrison once observed:"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"If you get too cold, they tax the heat;"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"If you take a walk, they tax your feet."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We are a mobile, highly-connected society and as taxes become more onerous and as the business climate deteriorates in these states, people vote with their feet."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,Taxpayers and businesses leave.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"The tax base erodes and the fiscal situations of these states gets more ominous, yielding massive budget shortfalls."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,It is a vicious cycle.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We won’t repeat those mistakes in Florida.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We will always remain a low-tax state.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,And we will never have an income tax!
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I have proposed more than $330 million in tax relief for Florida families, including a property tax cut."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We must keep our economic momentum going!
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"To those doing business in states that have a bad business and political climate, my message is this: come to Florida.  We will maintain a healthy economic environment, we welcome your success and we won’t chase jobs away through economic ignorance and demagoguery."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We are also committed to modernizing our infrastructure, and I know President Galvano is focused on making that happen. Thank you, Mr. President for your efforts."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"There are areas where Florida can do better.  I hope the Legislature passes legislation to reform the issue of AOB, which has become a racket."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"And its clear we need reform of our occupational licensing regime, which borders on the absurd and primarily serves to frustrate opportunities for Floridians."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"You can become a sniper in the Marine Corps by completing training for 79 days, which equates to 632 hours; becoming a licensed interior designer in Florida requires 1760 hours."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"You can earn jump wings by completing Army Jump School in three weeks, or about 168 hours; Florida law requires 1200 hours to become licensed as a barber."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Our DBPR secretary and your former colleague Halsey Beshears has identified a number of these requirements that need to be streamlined, rolled back or eliminated.  This project merits your support."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,EDUCATION
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Maintaining low taxes and a healthy economic climate are important, but the most important factor regarding Florida’s economic potential is human capital."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"If we support our university system, our state colleges and primary and secondary education, as well as the reforms needed to improve educational opportunities across the board, then we will be setting the stage for future economic success that will be the envy of the nation."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,As we sow so shall we reap.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m proud that Florida’s university system is ranked #1 in the nation — ahead of Texas, California and New York.  This wasn’t always so; the climb atop the rankings has been remarkable."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m not sure how many people outside Florida realize this, so I’m doing my part to spread the word.  I was in New York last week meeting with business leaders and stressed this fact and pledged that we will do even more to build a world-class talent pool."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We are poised for growth in finance, technology, health care, aerospace and more – let’s support the continued ascent of our universities so that these industries can grow by employing our own graduates in good, high-paying jobs in our low-tax, business-friendly environment."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Attending a traditional four-year brick-and-ivy institution is one way to get the advanced knowledge and skills necessary for achieving economic success, but we must recognize that it is not the only way – and for many it is not the best way."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Skills-based education offers a focused, and often more cost-effective means, by which students can acquire the tools they need to be successful."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Working with your former speaker and our Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran, I have proposed a plan to take Florida from middle of the pack to number 1 in workforce education by 2030."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Earlier this year, I visited Tampa Bay Technical High School to observe a successful example of workforce education first-hand.  I met Glenn Wester III, who is with us here today.  Glenn is a junior in the welding program and, even though he is not quite old enough, has already received job offers – good paying job offers!  He is also taking Advanced Placement courses and will have to choose between multiple pathways for success."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Glenn, keep working hard, we wish you continued success and I applaud the Hillsborough County School District for giving students like Glenn these opportunities."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Our workforce education initiatives include grants to place students in apprenticeships, money to train teachers in computer science and funds for workforce programs within our state college system.  These reforms will make a difference and deserve your support."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Florida has made strides in primary and secondary education since I graduated from public school in Dunedin in 1997, but we have a lot more to do.  For years, I’ve heard from parents and teachers about the problems with a system of standards, testing and curriculum modeled after common core.  Parents have been especially frustrated by not being able to help their kids with basic math problems."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"So I have instructed Commissioner Corcoran to spend the rest of this year engaged in consultation with parents, teachers, school administrators, and employers so that we can replace common core with high-quality curriculum, streamlined testing and a new emphasis on American civics.  We want a system that demands excellence and that also engenders public confidence."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We also need to do more to recruit, retain and reward great teachers.  To this end, I have proposed replacing Best and Brightest bonus program with a revised $423 million program that will reward more than 40,000 teachers with bonuses approaching $10k."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I’m also requesting $10 million for a tuition and loan forgiveness program for as many as 1,700 teachers who commit to teaching in Florida schools for 5 years.  Attracting and keeping great teachers in our classrooms should be a high priority."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Education opportunity shouldn’t be limited by parental income or zip code.  One way Florida has expanded opportunity has been through the Tax Credit Scholarship program for students from low-income families.  More than 100,000 students – nearly 70% of whom are African-American or Hispanic, with an average family income of roughly $26,000 per year – are utilizing the scholarship."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,The results have been positive: the Urban Institute recently released a study that found tax credit scholarship students are 43% more likely to attend a four-year college and up to 20% more likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree.  Students who use the scholarship more than four years are up to 99% more likely to attend college and up to 45% more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"More low-income families would like the opportunity to obtain a scholarship for their kids.  There are currently 14,000 students who qualify for the scholarship but are stuck on the waiting list."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Shareka Wright is a single mother of three who supports her family by driving a garbage truck for the city of Orlando.  While one of her sons is doing well in an Orange county district school, her two younger boys needed a different environment, as one struggled academically and the other was bullied.  But because her boys are on the waiting list for the tax credit scholarship program, Shareka might not be able to afford to keep them in this more favorable environment."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Shareka is doing her best to give her boys a better future.  I’m not satisfied to see hard-working parents like Shareka mired on a waitlist, and so I’m proposing to eliminate the waitlist by creating a new Equal Opportunity Scholarship that is similar to the tax credit scholarship."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We are a big, diverse state and one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to education.  Lets stand with working moms like Shareka and empower them to choose the best learning environment for their kids."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We also need to stand by students with special needs and their families.  That means eliminating the waitlist of 1,900 students for Gardiner Scholarships."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Donna and Michael Holt are here with their son Levi, who has Down syndrome.  Levi is on the waiting list for a Gardiner scholarship.  Students like Levi have unique abilities that require a customized learning environment that the Gardiner ESA can provide."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,The Gardiner scholarship is our way of saying that everyone counts and that these are lives worth living.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"And while we are at it, I wholeheartedly reject the callous disregard for human life displayed by the Governors of Virginia and New York.  We won’t allow that to happen in Florida."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,HEALTH CARE
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"We need to enact policies to make health insurance, prescription drugs and medical care more affordable for Floridians."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"As you are aware, health care is being hotly debated at the national level, so let me say:"
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,Any proposal that seeks to eliminate the private health insurance policies of millions of Floridians is unacceptable. Government has no right to take away the policies that Floridians earn through their jobs or purchase on the individual market.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I want Floridians to be able to purchase prescription drugs from Canada at lower prices.  There is an avenue under existing federal law to accomplish this; the President is supportive of this effort and has asked me to plow ahead, which will require navigating an institutionally hostile bureaucracy."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"This could save money for individuals, reduce costs for businesses and relieve pressure on our state budget."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I’m also open to any ideas that the Legislature has to tackle this problem.  One thing is clear: Floridians need relief from the rising costs of prescription drugs.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Bringing price transparency to health care can also help reduce costs, and I have instructed Secretary Mayhew from AHCA to expedite the price transparency database that the legislature required.  To make the tool effective, we need legislation to provide for shared savings policies so that patients receive a financial benefit when they choose a more cost-effective option."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I’m supportive of Speaker Oliva’s call to foster innovation and competition in our health care system.  We can’t just continue doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,PUBLIC SAFETY
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Last year at this time, the state was still reeling from the massacre at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School.  Out of that tragedy grew the MSD Commission, which earlier this year outlined a series of recommendations to improve security at Florida schools.  I support the recommendations and ask that you enact them into law."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"These reforms are a testament to the tenacity, courage and character of the families of the Parkland victims.  The hard work of those like Ryan Petty and Hunter Pollack, who is with us here today, has already helped save lives and has made our state stronger.  They should be commended for their efforts."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I have gotten to know a number of the families and one thing that has stuck with me is something I’ve heard a number of them say: that this was the most preventable school shooting in history.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"When I took office, many of the Parkland families felt that there had not been any accountability – at the school district or at the sheriff’s office – for the string of failures that culminated in the massacre.  So, I acted by successfully petitioning for a statewide grand jury investigation into school security failures in Broward County and other jurisdictions."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I also suspended Scott Israel as the Sheriff of Broward and replaced him with Gregory Tony.  That suspension will come before the Senate soon and the failures of the former sheriff are well-documented.  Why any senator would want to thumb his nose at the Parkland families and to eject Sheriff Toney, who is doing a great job and has made history as the first African-American sheriff in Broward history, is beyond me."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"But I judge not, lest I be judged."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,Florida will not be a sanctuary state — we won’t allow someone here illegally to commit criminal misconduct and simply be returned to our communities.  And we won’t tolerate sanctuary cities that actively frustrate law enforcement by shielding criminal aliens from accountability at the expense of public safety.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Here with us today are two angel parents, Bobby and Kiyan Michael from Jacksonville.  Their son Brandon was killed by a foreign national who was illegally in our country and who been deported on two prior occasions.  Brandon was a young man engaged to be married, but instead of planning a wedding Bobby and Kiyan had to plan a funeral.  Had our laws simply been enforced, Bobby and Kiyan might not have had to bury their son."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,Lets do right by the Michael family; lets prohibit sanctuary cities in Florida.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,International events usually have a particular resonance in Florida.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Earlier this year, I had a meeting in the Oval office alongside Senators Rubio and Scott as well as Congressman Diaz-Balart about the dire situation in Venezuela.  To the President’s credit, he heeded our advice and recognized Juan Guaidó as the interim president and made clear that the dictator Nicolás Maduro has got to go."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,The tragedy in Venezuela is a result of a failed socialist experiment – a system that is hostile to human liberty and contrary to human nature.  The tyranny that has resulted is the natural outgrowth of trying to impose this failed ideology on the people of Venezuela.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"To the Venezuelan exile community here in Florida, we stand with you and with the people of Venezuela who are seeking freedom and a better future for Venezuela.  The eyes of the free world have descended upon Venezuela, and it is imperative that freedom prevail."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We also know that the despair in Venezuela wouldn’t be possible without the nefarious influence of the Cuban government.  I applaud the President for allowing the application of Title III of the Libertad Act and support additional efforts to hold the Castro regime accountable.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I would like to see the Castro regime go the way of Maduro and to see a free and democratic Cuba take its place.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I offer my thanks to the Legislature for defending the U.S.-Israel relationship by enacting anti-BDS legislation.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,I reject attempts to target Israel for disfavored treatment and will enforce the anti-BDS provisions vigorously.  This whole enterprise of targeting Israel for economic harm is such a fraud and merely a cover for antisemitism.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"In Florida, rest assured that BDS is DOA."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,We will be taking a delegation to Israel in May and I look forward to furthering the relationship between Florida and Israel.
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,CLOSING
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"The lesson I learned from this is that sometimes it pays to be at the right place, at the right time."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"I think we here in this Chamber are the right leaders at the right time.  After all, many are called to serve in elected office, but only a few are actually entrusted with authority by the voters.  Fewer still are presented with the opportunities we see before us today."
Florida,Ron DeSantis,Republican,"Let’s fight the good fight, lets finish the race, lets keep the faith so that when Floridians look back on the fruits of this session, they will see it as one of our finest hours."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Lt. Governor Duncan, Speaker Ralston, President Pro Tem Miller, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, members of the General Assembly, constitutional officers, members of the Judiciary, Mayor Bottoms, members of the consular corps, my fellow Georgians:"
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"During the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells a parable about two builders. The wise builder built his home on the rock. As the parable goes, “The rain came down, the floods came, but it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock.”"
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"But the second builder was foolish. He built his house on sand. There was a great storm, and his house washed away."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"As a builder, this story always resonated with me. You have to pour concrete before you can frame a house. You must build on solid ground."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Over the last sixteen years, our state has experienced incredible growth and economic opportunity. Wages are rising, and the unemployment rate is the lowest in eighteen years. Thanks to the hard work of the legislature, Georgia is the top state for business – six years in a row. With low taxes, a business-friendly government, and access to logistics hubs like the Port of Savannah and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Georgia is the epicenter of job growth, the Hollywood of the South, and soon to be the Cyber Capital of the World."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Through our state’s oldest and largest industry, Georgia farmers are also feeding millions of people in countries across the globe. Thanks to the leadership and wisdom of Governors Sonny Perdue and Nathan Deal, Georgia has a solid foundation. The State of the State is rock solid."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Over the last eight years, we saw 800,000 brand-new private sector jobs created in Georgia. These investments touch every industry imaginable: in agribusiness, with machinery manufacturers like Caterpillar and Kubota and food processing companies like Perdue Farms and Harrison Poultry; in aerospace and aviation with Gulfstream, Pratt & Whitney, and TravelSky; in healthcare with Athena Health, Greenway Medical Technologies, and Kaiser Permanente; in cyber innovation with AirWatch, Honeywell, and Unisys; in manufacturing with Precision Products, Toyo Tire, and SK Innovation; and in transportation and supply chain infrastructure with Hapag-Lloyd, and Norfolk Southern Corporation."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"I applaud Governor Deal, Economic Development Commissioner Pat Wilson, and department officials for working to create economic opportunity, not only in Atlanta and the metro area but in every corner of this great state. As governor, I will continue to work with state and local officials to recruit industry leaders to Georgia."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Through the Georgians First Commission, we will review regulations that make it difficult for job creators to hire, expand, and invest. We will work to make government more efficient and put hardworking Georgians first."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"I am confident that we can build a stronger, more diverse economy. We can add a new designation to Georgia’s resume: #1 for small business. With conservative budgeting, Georgia has maintained a triple-A bond rating."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Our Rainy Day Fund stands at $2.5 billion. Our fiscal house is in order. Last year, the Legislature lowered state income tax rates and fully funded public school education. I am confident we can do it again."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"To enhance educational outcomes and build a 21st century state, we must invest in those who educate, inspire, and lead our students. 44% of Georgia teachers leave the profession in less than five years. To recruit and retain the best and brightest in our schools, we must remove heavy burdens in the classroom and keep teacher pay competitive."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"My 2020 budget proposal includes a $3,000 permanent salary increase for certified Georgia teachers. This is the largest pay increase for teachers in Georgia history and serves as a sizable down payment on my promise to ultimately raise pay by $5,000. We also include a 2% merit increase for all state employees. These hardworking Georgians play a vital role in serving our families and crafting Georgia’s future. We must continue to reward their efforts."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"In addition to investments in personnel, we must also prioritize school safety. In the amended budget for 2019, I have included $69 million in one-time funding for school security grants. All 2,294 public schools in our state will receive $30,000 to implement school security priorities determined by local school boards, administrators, teachers, parents, and students."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"But to keep our classrooms safe, we must also address the mental health issues that often lead to school violence. With $8.4 million in additional funding through the successful APEX program, we can focus on mental health in Georgia high schools. These professionals will engage with struggling students and provide critical resources to prevent disruptive and aggressive behavior. They will inspire, mentor, and keep our students safe. Together, we will secure our classrooms and protect our state’s most treasured asset – our children. "
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"With your help, we will continue to build. While places like Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah, and Columbus continue to grow and thrive, it still feels like the Great Recession in parts of Rural Georgia. Businesses are closing. Opportunities are drying up. People are losing faith."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"As governor, I will work to ensure that someone’s potential is not determined by their zip code or county. By working with the House Rural Development Council and their colleagues in the Senate, we can expand access to high-speed internet, quality healthcare, and good education."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Through strategic partnerships, we can ensure that every part of our state has access to opportunity – that kids can graduate and raise their families where they were raised, that local companies in Rural Georgia can thrive, that farmers and agribusiness leaders can get their Georgia Grown products to the marketplace, and that every Georgian is equipped with the right tools to succeed."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"By working across party lines, we can – and we will – stand with those impacted by Hurricane Michael. In the aftermath of the storm, I witnessed firsthand the devastation in South Georgia. The storm damaged forests, groves, and fields. It ripped up homes, churches, and livelihoods."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Today, we are joined by a hardworking farmer who runs his family’s cotton, soybean, and timber farm in Donalsonville, Georgia. He represents one of countless Georgians who took a severe hit from Hurricane Michael but is determined to move forward. This farmer and family man, Greg Mims, sits in the gallery today, and it is my honor to recognize him."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"I want to thank President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Governor Deal, members of the General Assembly, and Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black for their solid leadership in the wake of this disaster."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"I also applaud the efforts of officials at DNR, GEMA, the Georgia Forestry Commission, Georgia National Guard, Department of Public Safety, Department of Public Health, Department of Corrections, Department of Community Supervision, and all of the first responders who provided necessary aid after the hurricane. We will continue these recovery efforts. Let’s revive, rebuild, and renew hope in Rural Georgia."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"There’s no doubt that criminal justice reform will be a lasting legacy of the Deal administration. Without question, the leadership of Governor Deal and the General Assembly has changed our state for the better. I look forward to supporting initiatives that save costs, strengthen communities, and give non-violent offenders a second chance at life. To keep all Georgians safe, we must build on these reform efforts."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Today, I am honored to have one of Georgia’s most distinguished members of our law enforcement family with us. He is a fighter in the strongest sense of the word – a true hero among us. Last year, he was wounded in the line of duty and nearly lost his life. While chasing a criminal, he was shot right between the eyes. After multiple surgeries, I am proud to tell you that he’s in the gallery next to his wife, Kristen. Join me in welcoming - and thanking - Covington Police Officer Matt Cooper. Coop, we continue to pray for you."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"As Georgians, we must never forget the sacrifices of our law enforcement community. Last year, six officers paid the ultimate price in protecting and serving Georgia’s communities. To the loved ones of Locust Grove Police Officer Chase Maddox, Savannah Police Officer Anthony Christie, Ludowici Chief of Police Frank McClelland, Jr., Gwinnett County Police Officer Antwan Toney, DeKalb County Police Officer Edgar Flores, and Henry County Police Officer Michael Smith, you remain in our thoughts and prayers. Their service will never be forgotten, and we are forever grateful."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Fellow Georgians, it’s time to build. It’s time to renew our commitment to public safety. It’s time to honor those we lost by taking action. As governor, I am committed to addressing the rise of gang activity in our state – a growing threat requiring our immediate attention."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"According to a recent survey conducted by the Georgia Gang Investigators Association, there are over 71,000 validated gang affiliates and 1,500 suspected gang networks in our state. These gangs are pawns for Mexican drug cartels – pushing opioids and drugs, buying and selling children for sex."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"My budget proposal includes $500,000 in initial funds to form a gang taskforce within the GBI. This highly qualified group of experienced law enforcement personnel and prosecutors will work with local district attorneys and law enforcement to stop and dismantle street gangs. By utilizing the Criminal Gang and Criminal Alien Database, which will be funded with existing resources from the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, we can track and deport drug cartel kingpins who are terrorizing our communities. By working with Attorney General Chris Carr, federal, state, and local partners, we can undermine organized crime. Together, we can build a safer future for all Georgia families."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Finally, while different parts of our state have unique challenges and concerns, all Georgians deserve a patient-centered healthcare system that puts families first. The status quo is unacceptable. Seventy-nine counties have no OB/GYN. Sixty-four counties have no pediatrician. Nine counties have no doctor. Insurers are leaving the state, and hardworking Georgians are struggling to pay their premiums."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"We have included $1 million in the Department of Community Health’s budget to craft state flexibility options for Georgia’s Medicaid program. We will expand access without expanding a broken system that fails to deliver for patients. We will drive competition and improve quality while encouraging innovation. I will work with the legislature to grow the rural hospital tax credit, tackle the doctor shortage, and build a healthier Georgia."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"As we envision and plan for Georgia’s future, we should not forget how we got here – the road travelled and the people who stood with us. Today, my wife, Marty, and daughters, Jarrett, Lucy, and Amy Porter, are with us. I wouldn't be here without their support. Marty and I built businesses and a family together. She’s solid as a rock, and I know she’s going to make a fine First Lady. Today, Marty is in the seat where her late father, Representative Bob Argo, once sat. Thank you, Representative Hugley, for allowing Marty to share your seat today. You are incredibly kind."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"Mr. Bob was a good ole Southern Democrat who never met a stranger. He loved the University of Georgia and worked across the aisle to deliver for his district. Representative Argo raised Marty to be a fighter and a public servant. When I was a frustrated business guy who wanted to make a difference, he encouraged me to run for office. He stood with our family through thick and thin. His legacy inspires us daily. Representative Argo was a wise man and knew that building is faster when there’s more people involved – that we have more that unites us than divides us."
Georgia,Brian Kemp,Republican,"So join us, and let’s put hardworking Georgians first. Pick up a hammer and nails. Together, we can build a safer, stronger Georgia. Thank you, God bless you, and may God continue to bless the great State of Georgia."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Mr. Speaker, President Kouchi, former governors, distinguished justices of the courts, representatives of our congressional delegation, members of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature, elected officials, military leaders, honored guests, and all of you who took the time to be with us this morning."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Aloha.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Before I begin… Our first responders — whether they are police officers, firefighters, or lifeguards — take great pride in their professionalism and great satisfaction in knowing they are serving others and their community. If you ask them, they will tell you to a man and woman that they are just doing their job, even when they step into harm’s way. But, in truth, they do so much more, especially when the need for them arises. On Sunday, a desperate need did arise, and two heroes stepped up."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,I would like us to take a moment of silence for officers Tiffany Enriquez and Kaulike Kalama.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Chief Ballard – Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with the HPD ʻohana and with the families of these two brave officers.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"On January 1, we welcomed the dawn of not only a new year, but a new decade."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"For those under 30, that may not seem like a big deal."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,But for those who grew up without the internet — when The Lord of the Rings was a book you read and not a movie you watched — time has a way of sneaking up on us.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Could any of us have imagined the changes and discoveries that have already taken place in this century?
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• Smart phones,"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• 3-D printers, Facebook, and"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,• Self-driving cars.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And it seems that each year, change happens faster and faster."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"How do you keep up with it all? If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit, we can’t. We go along with the flow and hang on for dear life."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,But the issues that concern our families haven’t changed for as long as I can remember:
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• Finding a job that pays the bills,"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• Dealing with Hawaiʻi’s high cost of living, and"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,• Taking care of our family.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"A study sponsored by the Aloha United Way reported that a family of four in Hawaiʻi needs a combined annual income of $77,000 just to survive…to pay for food, housing, health care, childcare and, yes, taxes."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"If you asked working families in Hawaiʻi whether they make $77,000 a year, many would answer, “no.” If you asked families who made $77,000 whether that was enough, I suspect the answer would still be, “no.”"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"At various times, we’ve taken stabs at different aspects of the overall problem. We’ve taken bites out of the housing shortage. We’ve increased the minimum wage. We’ve started childcare and preschool programs. And we’ve provided tax relief for working families."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"As a state senator, I remember supporting many bills to help ease Hawaiʻi’s high cost of living. And I recall many others trying to do the same."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Hundreds of bills were introduced, many requested by the community, all competing to improve the quality of life in Hawaiʻi. The House selected their priorities, and the Senate did the same. Advocates successfully moved their priorities from committee to committee. In the end, we agreed on a budget and hundreds of bills that made life a little better."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"We went along with the flow and hung on for dear life. Still, the elephant in the room — the cost of living—got a little larger and harder to deal with each year."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Too many in our community, simply gave up and moved away."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And so, at the start of this new decade, it is appropriate to ask ourselves: Does it make any sense to continue to do business as usual?"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"That’s why House and Senate leadership, community leaders and my administration got together to look for a better way of helping working families. We challenged each other to identify ways to take on reducing the cost of living for working families. We committed to a package of bills that was outlined last week in our joint press conference. We committed to shaping these bills and ushering them through the legislative process. And we made a promise to make life better for our working families."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Moreover, we had an army to assist us. I would like to recognize House Speaker Scott Saiki, Senate President Ron Kouchi, their members, key department directors, and many business and non-profit leaders who participated in this historic collaboration. Whether you are up in the gallery or down here on the chamber floor, please stand to be recognized."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,A LIVING WAGE
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,The first thing we agreed to do was to put more money into pockets of working people.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"But how do you increase wages without increasing the cost of living? The two are joined at the hip. Clearly, increasing the minimum wage alone would not do it."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"But a modest increase phased over time, combined with targeted tax relief, could result in an annual cash benefit of $4,400 to each worker. We believe we have hit the sweet spot that will make a difference for our working families."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Still, some say, that is not enough. And that’s why our package also includes initiatives to reduce the cost of childcare and housing, two of the biggest expenses in a family’s budget."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,EDUCATION
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"The proposed bill on expanding affordable childcare complements the proposal we made last year to create a universal public preschool system for four-year-olds. To reach that goal, I noted we would need more than 300 pre-K classrooms."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"At the time, I had no illusion about the cost or difficulty of attaining that goal. And so we embarked on a phased process, a way of taking small but steady steps forward."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,But this new bill on childcare will allow us to do much more than that.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Today, half of our toddlers, about 20,000 statewide, have no access to childcare or preschool programs. By the end of this decade, we want to eliminate that gap, whether it’s through our pre-K classrooms, private preschools, or the proposed Learning to Grow centers. By the end of this decade, we want every three- and four-year-old in Hawaiʻi to have the opportunity to attend a childcare or preschool program."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Business as usual is NOT acceptable. We want to make an aggressive start now.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Instead of asking working parents to bring their toddlers to us, let’s bring these services to them, whether it’s in community centers, in condominium buildings, or suburban shopping malls."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Instead of waiting three years or more to construct new classrooms, let’s look at all the empty classrooms and underutilized facilities statewide to see if we can make better use of them."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Instead of trying to do all of this with just taxpayer dollars, why not leverage those funds through partnerships with private and nonprofit groups?"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We are committed to go the distance because we know our children’s future is at risk.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Education is the foundation of our economy and our quality of life. Everything, including our future, begins with how well we educate our children. And that is significantly affected by the kind of beginnings we provide for them."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We cannot let them down.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"In Hawaiʻi, the biggest expense for working families by far is housing, whether it’s rent or mortgage payments."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Young families in Hawaiʻi just cannot afford to buy that first home without help.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,The spiraling cost of homes in Hawaiʻi is driven by two forces: The first is the high cost of land. The second is real estate speculation.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And so in our joint package, we propose to build 17,000 affordable homes over the next decade on state-owned land in partnership with private developers. The homes would be sold as leasehold, effectively removing the biggest cost for developers: land. That, in turn, will dramatically bring down the price of the homes they build."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Moreover, as the landlord, the state will be able to keep these homes affordable while allowing leaseholders to reasonably share in the equity when they are ready to sell. In other words, we hope to take some of the wind out of speculators’ sails. In this way, we can also ensure that the leasehold property stays affordable forever."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"As part of our joint package on housing, we are proposing to invest $200 million for roads and infrastructure to stimulate interest in the University of Hawaiʻi’s housing development plans for its West Oʻahu campus."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"With 4,000 units already planned, we are very excited about the new energy these initiatives will inject into the project."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We are also proposing to provide $75 million for affordable housing on the Neighbor Islands.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"In addition, we want to streamline the permit process to generate additional interest from developers."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,This joint package works hand-in-hand with the progress we made together to make low- and middle-income rental units available to our working families. This not only provides for their immediate housing needs but helps them save for the day when they can buy a home of their own.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,But the real story lies with the families that we—you and I—have been able to help.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"About six years ago, Krysyan and Jonathan Durrett were living on the mainland when he was offered an internship in Hawaiʻi. The couple, who were born and raised in Hawaiʻi, returned to the islands with their three children and moved in with his parents. When Jonathan’s internship turned into a full-time job, they knew that their living arrangement would no longer work."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,The cost of living was overwhelming and finding a place to rent seemed impossible. They were faced with the tough choice of staying near family or moving back to the mainland where the price of everything was lower.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Fortunately, they were able to qualify for an affordable rental in Ewa Beach in a development built by Mutual Housing Association of Hawaiʻi with state assistance."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"That allowed the Durretts to not only stay in Hawaiʻi, but, more importantly, save for the future. And after six years, they were able to save enough money for a down payment for a home of their own. Krysyan credits living in the affordable rental community as the primary reason they were able to save and purchase a home in Hawaiʻi."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Krysyan and Jonathan are here with us this morning. Would you stand and be recognized?
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention private developments like Waiawa, Hoʻopili and Koa Ridge. Clearly, it will take the private and public sectors working in concert to meet all of our families’ housing needs."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Building homes is not just about building houses, but also about nurturing communities."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,And the importance we give to eliminating homelessness says as much about us as a community as any new development.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"From the start of this administration, working with the legislature and the private sector, we have made reducing homelessness a priority. At the time, Hawaiʻi had the highest per capita rate of homelessness in the country."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Between 2016 and 2019, we increased the number of homeless people moving into permanent housing by 73 percent. On average, we have moved over six hundred homeless individuals into permanent housing each month. Those are the statistics."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"When it comes to homelessness, progress is really measured one person and one family at a time. For those individuals, their stories are no longer about shuffling between the streets and temporary housing."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Kalani Lautele is a single father with three children. He works in construction, and in 2016 his rent was suddenly doubled, and he found himself and his children homeless and desperate. He was referred to the family assessment center in Kakaʻako where they stayed while waiting for affordable or public housing. Fortunately, Catholic Charities Hawaiʻi was able to find his family permanent housing."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"But that’s not the end of his story. Kalani needed a way to “pay forward” the help he was given. After settling in a home in Kalihi, Kalani continued to visit the center. And he brought with him his children and the entire youth football team he coached, to help with outreach events. They also brought donations for the families there, such as toiletries, food and bedding."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,I would like Kalani (and his family) to stand and be recognized for their strength of character and for the example they have set for others.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"I would also like to take a moment to recognize Lt. Gov. Josh Green for his work on the H4 initiative. The initiative provides medical services for homeless individuals through Joint Outreach Centers in Chinatown and Kāneʻohe. As you know, the Lt. Gov. has focused on the health concerns of the homeless and is also working on other projects, like the Kauhale Village concept, and addressing a broad range of community needs."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"On behalf of everyone involved in these efforts, I would like the Lt. Gov. to stand and be recognized."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,BUILDING ON PROGRESS
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"While the joint package has been the focus of our attention, we are also continuing to work on other important areas as well."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Great things do not happen overnight. To paraphrase Robert Kennedy, they begin with a vision to see things, not as they are, but as they might be."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,The transformation of agriculture in Hawaiʻi from large plantations that exported sugar and pineapple to smaller more diversified farms that grow food for local consumption is such a vision. But it has taken a while.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"The transition of our visitor industry from a sector that focuses on growth to one that embraces sustainability is just beginning. It, too, will take time."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"In fact, the shift to sustainability in many of the things we pursue—including energy, economic development and the environment—will continue long after we are gone. That is why we cannot lose sight of those broader goals, no matter the obstacles, changes in administration, or how long the process."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,AGRICULTURE AND SELF SUFFICIENCY
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Perhaps the longest transition we have experienced recently has been the transformation of our agricultural industry from large-scale farming to more diversified farms.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"But there is one important difference in today’s efforts from yesterday’s: And that’s technology. As in other fields, we have seen the rise of technology change the face of everything in society. In agriculture, it too has been a game changer. It has enabled farmers to produce higher yields in the field and more precise targeting strategies in the marketplace. Consequently, we are seeing a greater willingness to invest in local agricultural endeavors."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Over the last several weeks, we have seen a number of news articles on agricultural start-ups."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Mahi Pono, which bought 41,000 acres of former sugar cane land, is raising potatoes in central Maui. And they want to plant another 120 acres of citrus trees and 20 acres of non-GMO papayas. Their plans also include growing avocados, bell peppers, guava, lilikoi, oranges, lemons and limes."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Sensei Farms is transforming agriculture on Lanaʻi by using a mix of proven and innovative technology to power its hydroponic greenhouses on former pineapple fields. This mix of traditional farming and new technology is the wave of the future for agriculture throughout the state.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Mr. En Young of Sensei Farms is here with us today. Would you stand and be recognized?
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"More than at any other time in our history, local farmers have it within their grasp to make a difference in our drive toward self-sufficiency."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"At this time, I would also like to acknowledge State senators Donovan Dela Cruz and Mike Gabbard and representatives Richard Onishi and Richard Creagan, who have long been strong advocates for agriculture in Hawaiʻi."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,SUSTAINING OUR ECONOMY AND LIFESTYLE
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"You know, we can initiate a host of activities to encourage local food production, stimulate our economy, and protect our environment. But the key has always been whether we are able to keep those initiatives going. And so “sustainability” has been an integral part of our efforts."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"How do we sustain our economy, our lifestyle and our natural environment? We do it first by developing clean energy sources."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"With a flurry of commercial solar projects in the pipeline and local homeowners’ enthusiasm for residential solar power, we will meet our 2020 energy goal of attaining 30 percent of our energy needs from renewable sources."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,The significance of this initial pivot to clean and renewable energy cannot be overstated.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"We have become a leader in this effort, and our actions have inspired other states to follow. Since we set a goal to become carbon negative by 2045, four other states have followed our lead. So far, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas emissions and will meet our goal for 2020. And our utilities are meeting our clean electricity goals faster and at record low prices."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Today, 37 percent of Oʻahu’s single-family residences have rooftop solar. On certain days, Kauaʻi is already achieving 100 percent of electricity from clean energy sources, decades ahead of when we thought this would be possible."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We will continue to aggressively engage in actions that will continue to de-carbonize our economy and make our environment whole.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"In commerce, sustaining our economy has replaced the old mantra of growing the economy. And in fact, we are already seeing a shift in focus in our biggest industry."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"In 2019, the Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority shifted its priorities from increasing visitor arrivals to improving the visitor experience, while supporting the quality of life for residents. Through HTA’s Aloha ʻĀina program, 28 nonprofit and government agencies were given funding for programs to help protect Hawaiʻi’s natural resources."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"For example, the authority is working to repair and improve hiking trails like those at Mānoa Falls. Through its Kūkula Ola program, the authority has funded 28 programs this year and committed to fund 43 more programs in 2020 that perpetuate Hawaiian culture. The beneficiaries are programs and groups like the Lānaʻi Culture & Heritage Center, Hula Halau O Molokai, Hana Arts, the Edith K. Kanakaʻole Foundation, the Kalihi-Palama Culture & Arts Society, and so many more."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And while we are on the subject of Native Hawaiian culture, let me digress for just a moment and speak on the Thirty Meter Telescope and Mauna Kea."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Emotions have run high on both sides. The arguments are strong on both sides, and that’s what makes the situation so difficult. There is no easy answer or quick solution. We will have to work hard if we want to resolve this conflict. But I truly believe it can be resolved, if we put our heads and our hearts together."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,There are some who have encouraged me to take strong measures against those who are protesting on Mauna Kea. That would have been the easier course. But it is not just the authority of the law that is at stake. It is much more than that.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"What is also at risk is the glue that has always bound us together: our sense of aloha. It is the thing that underpins our laws and gives them meaning and an ethical foundation. That trust in each other is also sacred. And I will not break that bond, no matter how convenient or easy."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"At the heart of our dilemma is both the history of wayfinding and discovery and the future of wayfinding and discovery. If we have lost our way, we must find our way back."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"To do this, we must be open hearted, as well as open minded. We must listen, as well as speak with conviction, and we must have aloha for each other, in spite of our differences."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"I am of that mind, and I ask all to join me in continuing to look for a way forward. I stand ready to work with any and everyone who refuses to let this issue divide us. Let us together find a way forward."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,A NEW URGENCY FOR THE ʻĀINA
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Like our host culture, we sustain our environment by protecting it."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Stewardship of the ʻāina has always been a central part of public policy here in Hawaiʻi. It is embedded in our state motto and in the awareness of our children from an early age. The life of our lands has always depended on right thinking and a love of this place we call home.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"But there is a new danger threatening the ʻāina, and it comes from climate change. No one need tell us how global warming is directly impacting our lives or the lives of:"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• Families who live along the North Shore of Oʻahu, or"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• Those who suffered from recent historic storms on Kauaʻi, or"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"• The people of West Maui, who were affected by unprecedented high tides, or"
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,• Those affected by devastating wildfires on The Valley Isle.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Recently, Time Magazine named Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg its Person of the Year for 2019. She is a passionate and compelling youngster who believes we all have a part to play in preventing climate change. She sets an example for all of us."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"I would like to challenge our own young students to think about Greta’s message to us. The adults in this room often talk about sustainability and the future. But for those under 21, it is more about your future than ours. It is never too early to take ownership of it."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Because it’s as much about everyday activities as it is about large or sweeping public policy. We can work with the Legislature to permanently set aside 10,000 acres in conservation under the State’s Legacy Land program, as we have over the last year and a half. We can mandate 100-percent clean energy usage by 2045. But without your involvement, public policy is just that: a policy written on a piece of paper. It is your support and daily participation that transforms those policies into meaningful actions."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And if you don’t believe me, just ask the graduates of KUPU, a nonprofit youth organization dedicated to making a difference in their communities. Ask Aziz Agis, a KUPU alumni who maintained and restored hiking trails on Oʻahu; or Sean McDonough, who spent his days assisting in the preservation of natural area reserves throughout Oʻahu."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Also with us today is John Leong, Director of KUPU."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,I would like all of them to stand and be recognized for their contributions to making a difference in Hawaiʻi.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,They are only a few years older than those of you who are still in school. The future will be here faster than you think. But you don’t have to wait for that day to come. These young folks have shown how you can make a difference right now.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,CHANGING HAWAIʻI’S TRAJECTORY
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"As the saying goes, time waits for no man or woman—no matter how young or old."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"We have much on our plate. Those on this floor know better than most, how arduous the journey is in laying the groundwork for a thriving community and a better life."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"We also know that no one individual has all the answers. Government cannot do it alone. But what we cannot accomplish alone, we can with the help of others."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Here in Hawaiʻi, we intimately understand that truth. Throughout our history, we have tested it over and over again. During the plantation era, communities banded together to provide for each other when others would not. In the early 1900s, workers came together to fight for higher pay and better working conditions. Their efforts resulted in improving the work environment for all."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Today, at the start of a new decade, we have it within our power to change the lives of our working families. We have it within our power to change the trajectory of Hawaiʻi’s future. That is the underlying belief of this joint package by the House, the Senate, my administration, and the community."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,There are cynics out there who will dismiss the notion of government working together. But working together: That’s what Hawaiʻi has always been about.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"ʻOhana is not a cliché. It is about a whole body of values centered around family, in the largest sense of the word."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Our working families have taken it on the chin for far too long. They are the backbone of our workforce and the heart of our communities.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"While some have opted to leave the islands, many have not: Because Hawaiʻi is not just a place to build a house. It is our home."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We all deserve a chance to earn a decent day’s wage for a decent day’s work.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We all deserve an opportunity to own a home of our own.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We deserve the best education for our children…
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"And, someday, the opportunity to see our grandchildren playing on our beaches."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"More importantly, we, in government, owe it to every working family to give this our best shot."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Earlier, I recognized those who played a part in putting this joint package together. They took a chance and stood up for change. They delivered a package that’s aggressive and bold."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,We must be just as aggressive and bold in making it happen. Half measures will only add up to half a loaf. It will not nurture our families.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,I believe we can overcome the challenges facing us as a state and work together to create a better life for all of us.
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to stand up and be counted. It is time for us to put some skin in the game."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,"I believe in Hawaiʻi, and I believe in all of you. Let’s get to work."
Hawaii,David Ige,Democrat,Mahalo and aloha.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Speaker, Mr. Pro Tem, Madam President, honored legislators, my fellow constitutional officers, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the judiciary, my family, friends, and my fellow Idahoans."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Before I begin, let me acknowledge our new First Lady, Teresa, and our family – Adam and Angela, and David and Kelsey. A friend of mine refers to his wife as gravity, for her ability to keep him grounded. Teresa serves that purpose for me as well as the whole state of Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,It is humbling to address you as Idaho’s 33rd Governor. I’m used to a slightly different vantage point during this speech. I was here more than 42 years ago as a legislative intern.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Legislators – I look forward to working with you to achieve our shared vision of making Idaho the best possible place to live for this generation and future generations of Idahoans.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I stand on the shoulders of great men and women who have mentored me along my way. Many are in this room today. Thank you for guidance and support.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As Idaho’s new commander-in-chief, I want to thank the men and women serving in the Idaho National Guard. Last summer, our Idaho Army Guard deployed three Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters and their crews to Afghanistan. Godspeed, and I look forward to welcoming them home this spring."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Please join me in thanking Adjutant General Mike Garshak, all members of the Guard, and Idaho’s veterans – past and present – for their service to our nation."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Let me say something about my predecessor and partner these past 10 years. Governor Butch Otter led Idaho during a challenging time in our history, facing down the worst recession in 70 years. Now, Idaho is the fastest growing state in the country. Let us honor his legacy by keeping our budget balanced while investing in the future. Thank you for your service, Governor Otter."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"I stand here today not to reminisce about Idaho’s past, but to look to our future."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As Governor, I will seek to reflect our shared Idaho values and aspirations."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"This means making decisions through one lens: the lens of ensuring the best possible opportunities for us, our children and grandchildren to remain in Idaho and enjoy our unparalleled quality of life."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Making decisions with a long-term perspective means staying focused on creating a regulatory and tax environment where Idahoans can get good-paying jobs.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,It means having world-class schools.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,It means delivering accessible and affordable healthcare.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"It means giving citizens a reason to be confident in state government, by making government responsive, transparent, and accountable."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,My team of agency directors and administrators is mostly in place. A requirement for each of them is a commitment to implementing our shared vision of creating the best possible opportunities for Idahoans to prosper. I’m humbled by their willingness to serve Idaho. I’d like them to stand and be recognized.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"From Boundary to Bear Lake counties, and Letha to Leadore, I can tell you with confidence— the state of our state is strong."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Idahoans’ incomes are the fastest growing in America. We have the highest number of people employed in our state’s history.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Due to the good work of the folks in this room, Idaho remains a model for fiscal responsibility."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,There is no shortage of success stories that reflect the strength of our state’s economy.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Woodgrain Millworks, a Fruitland-based family-owned company operates sawmills and manufactures doors and windows. Under Kelly Dame, the company recently expanded in Nampa. They acquired and modernized the old sawmill in Emmett, assisting in our efforts for forest health."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"The Dame sons— Brooks, Taylor, and Tanner— created Proof Eyewear. They took a small company they started in their garage and now sell wooden sunglasses in more than 20 countries. The family typifies the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In Idaho Falls, Brad LaPray founded BiologiQ to create a useful plastic from the excess starch produced during potato processing. BiologiQ has grown from a simple concept into an industry-leading, sustainable bioplastics provider. It is another example of an innovative Idaho company using waste and turning it into a thriving business."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In Coeur d’Alene, Cody Peterson and Andy Huska founded Rohinni, a homegrown micro-LED manufacturer that’s become a leading technology company. They design robots that install lots of tiny LED lights on everyday electronic gear. Their business is diversifying Idaho’s economy, adding to our growing tech sector, and providing high-wage careers."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In Arco, Dragon Fly Tarps manufactures custom tarps for the outdoor industry. The company just moved from the local business incubation center and continues to grow."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,These companies and many others across Idaho ultimately offer our kids more opportunities to stay home or come back to Idaho.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Our state is on an incredible trajectory. With your help, I intend to lead us to the next level."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Making decisions with a long-term perspective means state government is fiscally sound and invests taxpayer dollars wisely.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Last year, we delivered one of the largest tax cuts in state history. As a result, state income and business tax rates are the lowest since 1934. Idahoans are enjoying bigger paychecks."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Even though sales tax and corporate tax revenues have been robust, our personal income tax receipts are falling short. The federal tax code changed recently, but few Idahoans know they need to update their tax withholdings. I am ordering the Tax Commission to do all they can to better inform taxpayers of what they need to do to avoid a surprise income tax bill."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"My team is following this issue closely, confident revenues will eventually match the rapid pace of economic growth. Though we are confident, in true Idaho fashion, we will not spend money until it’s in the bank."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,My budget recommendation will balance our books and fulfill important promises.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I propose working together with you to set the stage next year – using our budget surplus – to eliminate the grocery tax once and for all.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Additionally, any new tax exemption should be tied to a proportional reduction in state spending or real income generation."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As a conservative, I will utilize all other mechanisms to ensure our state remains fiscally sound over the long- term."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,It is prudent to live by the advice of Speaker Bedke’s grandfather: It won’t be the bad years that put you out of business; it’s what you did in the good years that sets you up for failure or success.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,As we review our state budget—we must ask key questions:
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Is there too much spending on autopilot? Are we putting off maintenance that will cost our children more tomorrow? Do we have adequate rainy-day funds? How do we structure the surplus eliminator?
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,These measures and my proposed budget ensure we avoid the short-term fiscal mistakes that other states and the federal government continue to make.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Let’s talk about my number-one priority for our state budget: education.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Education policy requires long-term planning and commitment.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"These past four years, with the hard work of stakeholders and many legislators in this room, Idaho has a successful record of responsible investment in education. We have increased the budget for our schools by 32 percent. This past year, Idaho teachers received one of the nation’s largest year-to-year pay increases."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As Governor, I will continue our momentum and be an unrelenting advocate for educational excellence in our state."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"To amplify the voices of those on the front lines of education, I will create a Children’s Cabinet to advise me throughout my term on a variety of education issues. My Children’s Cabinet will consist of traditional education stakeholders, parents, and groups across our state dedicated to advocating for children."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Our Task Force on Public Education and its five-year plan has been the envy of other states. It has been the force behind an unprecedented, sustained effort to improve Idaho education."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"My budget recommendation implements the fifth year of the task force recommendations. This investment puts in place the next phase of increased teacher salaries. I’m also recommending an increase to the popular Advanced Opportunity program, which saves Idaho families in tuition costs and provides stepping stones for students wanting to go-on to post-secondary opportunities that best suit them."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Now that we’ve agreed on a new Idaho Reading Indicator, I want to boost our efforts for literacy."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,My budget recommendation proposes that we double literacy program funding to $26 million.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"The school districts will decide the best ways to use the funds to raise reading scores among their students. They will choose from a variety of proven intervention methods such as full-day kindergarten, reading coaches, and summer reading programs. The variety of methods recognizes no one kid is the same and that Boise may not have the solution for what works in Bonners Ferry or Blackfoot."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Our goal must be to ensure all kids begin at the same starting line in life. By the third grade, our students must learn to read so they can read to learn."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Our state still has many challenges when it comes to recruiting teachers.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In addition to supporting the next phase of teacher salary increases, my budget recommendation fulfills my promise to raise starting teacher pay to $40,000 a year."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,As we reward our educators we expect school districts to continue working with us on reporting measurements that Idahoans need to validate increased education investments.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,We are proud of these efforts but there is still more to do.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Drawing on the successful model we’ve been using, I invite you to join me in creating an initiative I’m calling Our Kids, Idaho’s Future. The charge of this broad-based task force will be to look at our education system holistically and prioritize where we should invest the next available dollar."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,This initiative will provide Idaho’s next five-year blueprint for education investment and reform.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"I will continue to focus on increasing Idaho’s go-on rates and accomplishing our goal of having 60-percent of our 25- to 34-year olds with a completed degree or a professional certificate. To do that, we must expand career technical opportunities."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Further, my budget recommendation increases funding for Opportunity Scholarship applicants, providing a market-based approach to higher education funding, with money following the students and allowing them to choose the institution and degree that best fits their needs."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In my work on economic development, I know there’s a strong correlation between our education system and the attractiveness of our state to entrepreneurs and businesses."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Most importantly, a strong education system helps ensure we keep our best and brightest here in Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"From the roads you drive to take your children to school to the hunting licenses you purchase, like it or not, the state has a monopoly on many services citizens cannot provide themselves. With this role, comes responsibility and accountability to Idahoans."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As your Governor, I pledge to champion citizen confidence in state government."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I’ve been frustrated with the major shortcomings in customer service at the Division of Motor Vehicles. The issues stem from contracting procedures. I have asked my new director at the Department of Administration to identify critical lessons from the DMV situation and provide a thorough review of our state purchasing and contract administration processes. Idahoans deserve an action plan for better results from government.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,State government has a duty to protect the data citizens entrust to us. I chaired the Cybersecurity Task Force three years ago and we have made progress on this important issue.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Following these efforts, my budget recommendation lays out a plan for IT and cybersecurity modernization. This effort will significantly reduce our cyber vulnerability and provide long-term savings with the ultimate goals of protecting citizens’ data and building public confidence."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,There are other areas where we must maintain the trust of Idahoans.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,On election day over 60% of voters approved Medicaid expansion. For months I made it clear I would honor the will of the people. I intend to work with you to implement Medicaid expansion using an Idaho approach.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,We need spring in our safety net so that there are multiple pathways for the gap population to move off Medicaid and onto private coverage.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"While making health care available to low-income individuals we should also do what we can to make affordable, accessible, quality health care available to all Idahoans."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"An unintended outcome of the Affordable Care Act is that too many people are priced out of health insurance coverage. In the past two years, the number of uninsured Idahoans increased by 125,000 – almost double the gap population. As Idaho continues to enjoy the fastest-growing economy in the nation, the number of insured Idahoans should be increasing not decreasing."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,We must pursue strategies that contain health care costs.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,That’s why I joined with Governor Otter last year in issuing an executive order on state-based individual market health plans. As Governor I will continue these efforts. These health care plans are comprehensive and provide our citizens more affordable choices.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"The fact is we have a proven track record of delivering Idaho solutions on health care. When Idaho opted for a state-run health insurance exchange, we created an Idaho solution instead of adopting a federal one-size-fits-all mandate."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Your Health Idaho has since been recognized as one of the best exchanges in the country.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I intend to continue developing Idaho solutions that bring health care costs down for all Idahoans. I have met with federal partners to pursue alternatives for affordable health care plans.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I will fight for state flexibility and state control to develop Idaho solutions for Idaho families.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Public safety is one of the pillars of state government. Idahoans enjoy a high quality of life in part because we live in one of the safest states in the nation.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"We must hold those who violate our laws accountable, but we also must invest in changing their behavior, so our communities will be safer once offenders pay their debt to society."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,My budget recommendation takes on this challenge in a way that provides not only an increase in our prison capacity but also the resources needed to reduce the flow of inmates to our prisons. This will be done by expanding the St. Anthony Work Camp in eastern Idaho and opening a community reentry center in northern Idaho.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In addition to providing timely relief to Idaho’s overcrowded prisons, these combined 220 beds focus specifically on helping those in custody acquire critical skills to successfully transition back into society after release."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Former offenders cannot be successful after reentry and on parole if we don’t have the necessary bed space and programs – such as drug courts – to halt the revolving door.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Help for substance abuse is often only available once a person becomes an offender. There is a clear nexus between mental health and substance abuse. We must intervene in these areas prior to individuals entering our criminal justice system.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Communities across Idaho face the scourge of opioid addiction and other substance abuse problems. Fortunately, there is a solid foundation of work on this issue. Two years ago, the Idaho Office of Drug Policy and the Department of Health and Welfare convened a stakeholder group that put together a strategic five-year action plan on tackling the issue of opioid addiction in Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,We know the challenge is larger than just opioid addiction. Many problems that begin with opioids evolve into heroin and fentanyl.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Looking ahead, I will issue an executive order on substance abuse – formalizing this existing opioid plan, broadening these efforts, directing future resources, and creating non-offender programs for substance abuse."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,This makes the most sense because treating addicts and those with mental health problems in prison is expensive and often too late.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As we seek ways to reduce health care costs and protect the public, we also must make sure state government is reducing all unnecessary barriers to prosperity."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"One barrier is the daunting financial reality facing first-time homebuyers, particularly young people just starting their careers and families."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,One specific proposal I will champion to help more Idahoans achieve the American Dream is the First-Time Home Buyer Savings Account. This account will encourage young families to set aside part of their pre-tax income to make a down payment on their first home.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Idaho is seeing unprecedented economic growth in many parts of the state. However, that growth has not been matched in all our communities. In my travels, I constantly hear how the absence of adequate broadband"
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,infrastructure is a deterrent to growth and economic development. The Idaho Department of Commerce spent the past year analyzing the statewide challenge of inadequate broadband.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"To ensure Idaho can adapt to the rapidly evolving digital world, we must actively work to improve Idaho’s broadband access, pursuing all options to increase broadband connectivity. I will work with the Legislature to ensure both rural and urban Idaho are connected and well-positioned to attract and create maximum success."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"I am also committed to knocking down other barriers to independence and prosperity. In May 2017, I issued the Licensing Freedom Act executive order."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Late last year, I finalized a report that outlined the scope of occupational licensing in Idaho and provided key recommendations. Working closely with the Legislature I intend to fulfill all recommendations from the Licensing Freedom Act – reducing regulatory burdens and improving customer service while protecting the public."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,My first executive order as Governor will put in place two of those recommendations: sunrise and sunset processes for future occupational licensing laws.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"To reduce overall regulatory burdens on our citizens and businesses, I will issue another executive order requiring state agencies to revoke two regulations for every new regulation they want to implement. This commitment to cutting red tape will ensure we are governing with the lightest possible hand."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Looking long-term, we must address transportation deficiencies. I ask you to join me in looking at these long- term needs – specifically, the safety of our roads and bridges and the necessary improvements to preserve our citizens’ most precious commodity: their time. It is critical that we provide the needed road capacity to get our people and products to their destinations in the most efficient manner."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,All these efforts will help Idaho remain a beacon for prosperity and opportunity in America.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Agriculture remains the backbone of Idaho’s rural economy. As is often the case, agriculture is coping with the effects of significant challenges, from commodity prices to transportation and trade."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"As they have for generations, progressive farmers and ranchers meet these challenges by increasing their production and efficiency. Idaho’s wheat yield was up 15 percent and set a record this year. The barley yield is up 10 percent from last year, and alfalfa is up 19 percent. Idaho jumped Oregon to become the number two hop producing state in the nation. In the past 16 years, Idaho’s dairy production has doubled."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Idaho remains a heavily trade-dependent state, with around $2 billion in agricultural exports. When markets are open, agriculture makes the most of those opportunities. When markets are disrupted, we feel it."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,The profitability of Idaho agriculture and its ability to compete nationally and internationally is dependent upon the time and cost of getting our products to consumers.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"I look forward to working with you to increase rail access, address truck shortages, and reduce the burdens of federal regulations."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"You all know water is Idaho’s lifeblood, and we’ve made great strides in protecting it."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Under the leadership of the Water Resource Board, we have doubled our goal of refilling and replenishing our critically important Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, adding more water this year than was removed. While this is an impressive accomplishment, this must be an ongoing effort."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Regardless of the water year, we must focus on expanding the water infrastructure across our state."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"If water is Idaho’s lifeblood, our public lands are surely one of our state’s greatest assets. Idaho-based collaboration is key to addressing the many issues facing public lands. Together, we must responsibly manage and protect the special places that make Idaho unique. As Governor, I will work to expand access and tackle threats to our public lands."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"This work will protect important industries for our economy. From motorized recreation, rafting, skiing, and hunting, to hiking, fishing, and camping, Idaho’s outdoor recreation industry generates billions in consumer spending each year and supports 78,000 jobs across the state. Iconic companies like Smith Optics, Buck Knives, CLIF Bar, Vista Outdoor, and numerous guides and outfitters call our state home."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Idaho’s lands and waterways provide unparalleled outdoor recreation opportunities, enhancing the quality of life for Idahoans and attracting visitors, which in turn power urban and rural economies across our state."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,There are threats to our public lands that must be confronted.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Wildfire is a part of living in the West.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Several factors contribute to the increasing frequency of catastrophic wildfires. These fires threaten public safety and pump millions of tons of pollutants into the air, harming the health of our citizens. They damage wildlife habitat and contaminate our pristine waters. They disrupt our economy and cost taxpayers millions of dollars every year."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"One of those threats is the buildup of fuels on our public lands closest to where we live, work, and play."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"A few weeks ago, I signed a first-of-its-kind agreement between Idaho and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This collaborative agreement will reduce wildfire risk, improve forest health and enhance wildlife habitat, by actively managing more acres of federal forests."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"The new “shared stewardship” approach unifies land management activities that are now disjointed across federal, state, and privately-owned tracts. We’ll use all the tools available to us to reduce fuels around communities, including timber harvest, prescribed burns, and other activities."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"We’re already seeing a return on our investment in the Good Neighbor Authority, a program that utilizes state employees and contracting processes for restoration work on federal lands."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Idaho is leading the country in our fresh, collaborative approach to land management. Other states have already reached out to Idaho for the Shared Stewardship blueprint we created with the Feds."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In addition, there are now over 300 ranchers and farmers who are members of nine rangeland fire protection associations across southern Idaho. The initial attack and intel they provide on more than 9 million acres of Idaho’s rangeland have given Idaho significantly improved chances against the devastation of large wildfires."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is one of our state’s largest employers. It is a national asset dedicated to our energy and security interests.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"I have been impressed to see collaboration between the lab and our state’s universities. Those enhanced ties will result in a more secure nation, a thriving laboratory, and strengthened university programs. Most importantly, it presents opportunities for our state’s best and brightest students to work and raise their families right here in Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"With that in mind, I am pleased to announce that I am authorizing the continuation of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy (LINE) Commission. The LINE Commission will remain dedicated to advising us so we can promote the advancement of nuclear energy and ensure the vitality of the INL."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"There is an incredible opportunity for Idaho, its businesses, and its institutions of higher learning to lead our nation, and the globe in pushing the new frontiers of safe, clean nuclear energy development."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"In addition to world class research, Idaho has one of the most affordable and sustainable energy supplies in America. It’s clean, with a mix of hydroelectric, wind, and solar. This energy mix and low cost make Idaho competitive in attracting new industries."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,I am intent on seizing this moment.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"Through the free market and the innovations at the INL, Idaho will continue to expand opportunities for clean and affordable energy for our citizens and the world."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Idaho is ready to lead.
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"My friends, if we create an environment that brings about economic prosperity, if we continue to invest and modernize education, if we do what we can to make healthcare accessible and affordable, if we invest in our infrastructure, if we protect our natural resources, and if we assure citizen confidence in government, we will keep our best and brightest here in Idaho."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,"It is an honor to offer this State of the State to the interns, pages, young viewers, and our children and grandchildren. When they eventually occupy these seats here, in the People’s House – if we do the job before us now – I am confident they will thank us in the decades to come."
Idaho,Brad Little,Republican,Thank you and God bless Idaho.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Speaker Madigan, President Cullerton, Leader Durkin, Leader Brady, Lieutenant Governor Stratton, Attorney General Raoul, Secretary White, Comptroller Mendoza, Treasurer Frerichs, Members of the General Assembly, honored guests and citizens, and the extraordinary First Lady of Illinois, my wife MK. Thank you all for your warm welcome. I ask that we begin today by taking a moment to grieve with our neighbors in Aurora over the grave tragedy that occurred less than a week ago. Five good people killed in an evil act of workplace violence. Five police officers who were injured when they ran into gunfire. As I said Friday when I visited Aurora, may the memory of those that we lost be a blessing; may their memory fuel our work to bring peace to our state; and may G-d bless the brave law enforcement officers who continue to run toward danger. Please join me in a moment of silence."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,Every one of us who serves in public office becomes a student of history. So few people have held these jobs – we must allow the experiences of those who came before us to help shape what lies ahead.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Every year, the Governor of Illinois is required to provide the General Assembly with a proposed budget and an update on the condition of our state. It's a tradition in true keeping with our democracy and a task that requires humble honesty and some bold optimism. Today I offer that proposal and report with an eye toward our shared history and our hopes for the future."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Illinois' 200-year history is a web of recurring challenges, the same themes recycling with each new decade. Indeed, when reviewing past reports to the General Assembly by previous governors, the same problems are raised over and over again: There is not enough money to address social ills, not enough jobs to employ people, not enough resources to adequately maintain and build our infrastructure, and not enough attention to the plight of working families. It may not surprise you to learn that these problems existed in 1819, they existed in 1919 and they exist today in 2019."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"History can be a cruel exercise in pessimism if you narrow your gaze. But if you widen your vision just a little bit, you will see that the recurring reports from the past have been occasionally dotted with unapologetic optimists who focused on tackling old problems with new ideas and new vigor, reducing the burden for each generation along the way."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"One of those unapologetic optimists was Governor Henry Horner, who took office in 1933. It puts the current day in honest perspective to think about the challenges Horner faced."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"The Great Depression had just begun…Nearly half of Illinois' work force was unemployed…Hungry workers were marching on Springfield…Teachers had not received a paycheck in nearly a year…Labor disputes were ending in bloodshed…Banks were shuttering… And to add to it all, floods were sweeping across wide swaths of the state."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Nevertheless, with the daunting nature of the state's condition, Horner approached his job with optimism, with wit and with a dogged work ethic. In a speech soon after he took office, he said:"
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"""We have got to hurdle a few more obstacles before we are on the broad highway of return to normal conditions. However, the road is clearly in sight."" Today, that is where we find ourselves again."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"The road to normal conditions is in sight. However, to get there, we must begin with an honest accounting of the struggles of the last few years and the challenges left behind."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Illinois is faced with a $3.2 billion budget deficit and a $15 billion debt from unpaid bills. Last year alone, the state paid out more than $700 million in late payment penalties. That's enough to cover free four-year university tuition for more than 12,000 students."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,We are dealing with a fundamental structural deficit that has existed for quite some time and spanned the administrations of several governors. And it won't be solved until we rethink our spending priorities and some basic revenue issues facing the state.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"During a time of unprecedented economic growth across the country, we lost four valuable years because of an ideological battle."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,That stops now.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Budgeting will not be done any more by taking the state hostage, or by court orders, consent decrees and continuing appropriations but instead by debate and compromise and a return to regular order. We will work together earnestly to solve the state's problems. We will disagree at times on important things, but the work we all came here to do will get done."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"To that end, the budget I present to you today is an honest proposal – the costs are not hidden, the revenues I propose are not out of reach, the hole we need to fill is not ignored. There's no fantasy line item called ""Working together or executive management."" Instead this budget proposal reflects some of my most deeply held values – and the hopes of voters who sent us here – but tempered by the knowledge that we must hold the line on spending in the context of the revenue available and the diminished condition of our state government."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Undoubtedly all of you will bring your own priorities, ideas, and concerns to the budget process. I welcome that conversation – that's as it should be. We are all here, Democrats and Republicans, with the common desire to serve the people of our state well. And we do that better when we talk to each other, and more importantly, listen to each other."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I have tried in the weeks leading up to today to get to know each of you, to meet your families, to dance together to Maroon 5 songs, and to have an open door to conversation and collegiality and finding common ground. As it turns out, some of you are pretty good dancers! Some of us, not so much."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,All I'm suggesting is I don't think we spend enough time getting to know one another as people before we get to know one another as political opponents.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"My first week here, Senator Sue Rezin stopped by the Governor's office to introduce herself. I invited her to sit with me so I could learn about her district and, we talked about how we can attract more business to Northern Illinois."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I found out a little bit more about Sue. She's a mom of four, runs a real estate business with her husband, and started volunteering for the Make-A-Wish foundation 30 years ago when she was first starting her family because it offered her a flexible schedule. I gotta say I'm not sure how a Mom of four finds any flexibility in her schedule but I'm impressed with the tremendous generosity of spirit that she looked for the opportunity to give her time to those in need when she must have barely had any time for herself."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I will not soon forget, even when we inevitably disagree, that Senator Rezin extended a hand in friendship to me on my first few days on the job. Sue makes no bones about being a conservative. And I'm not shy to say I'm a Democrat. But I know we will get more done for Illinois by listening to each other, which we will do with respect and civility."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"It is with the knowledge that people with true generosity of spirit occupy both sides of the aisle here in Springfield, that I set out on the task of providing a new direction for our state. This is not the work of just one year. Real fiscal stability requires a long-term commitment to paying down debt, investing in critical infrastructure, and stabilizing our pension system."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"It also requires a recognition that to lower costs and increase revenue over the long term we must make investments in education, livable wages, innovative human service programs and job training. We must stop slashing programs that build future prosperity – if we cut skills training and college affordability, we curb near term economic growth, lower our prospects for future revenue, and drive businesses away. If we don't fund inexpensive gun violence prevention programs, we will see more tragedy and higher public safety expenditures. If we don't have strong social service programs that assist families dealing with a loved one's mental health crisis, then we increase a family's suffering and increase the potential future financial burden on the state. In the past it has been the practice of too many politicians to be short sighted about slashing costs and then to bemoan the state of the state when those cuts have long-term consequences on the economy."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,So let's not hollow out vital government services any more.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Instead, we must focus on making government more efficient and effective. Let's make sure we are focused on truly managing and measuring the real results of state programs. Taxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent wisely. Programs that don't work need to be eliminated. And we need to explore new ways to address old problems."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Efficiently saving tax dollars, though, isn't enough to lift Illinois out of our fiscal mess. We must also grow jobs."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"We can do that by fostering a business environment in Illinois that will attract talent and entrepreneurs from all over the country. We need to continue to grow our position as a top-tier startup and technology ecosystem, and we are doing that in this budget with new investments and by re-prioritizing dollars within the departments of our state government."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"We are a big state with real infrastructure and transportation options, world class logistics companies and some of the busiest distribution centers in the nation. We must be prepared to make a big investment in our transportation and infrastructure with the passage of a Capital Bill that will be introduced in this legislative session."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,We can grow our economy and make it more inclusive by taking advantage of the talent among the diverse people of our state. That's why we must promote the development of sustained wealth in black and brown communities by being purposeful about increasing the number of minority-owned businesses eligible for state procurement opportunities and by attracting private capital to build out new businesses and jobs in Opportunity Zones. And I want downstate Republicans and Democrats to work together with me on a Downstate Revitalization Plan to encourage the creation of new businesses and jobs and foster the growth of existing ones in struggling communities so they can thrive.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"To get to fiscal stability and eliminate our structural deficit, there's no quick fix. It took decades to get us into this mess. It will take at least several years to get us out of it."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,We must therefore embrace a multi-year approach with fair principles and smart investments in our people. Our state does well when our people do well.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I want to be clear about this…this Fiscal Year 2020 budget is balanced, but that's not enough. This is only Year One of a multi-year endeavor, and very importantly it is built on the state's current regressive tax structure that I do not favor and that puts the greatest burden on working families. Not only is our tax system unfair, it's also inadequate to solve our long-term financial challenges."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,It's time for a change.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,Workers deserve an income tax cut and a property tax break. A fair tax system will allow us to eliminate the structural deficit that has plagued our state for nearly two decades.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,There is unanimous agreement in this room that if we want to solve our state's fiscal woes we cannot continue on the path we are on. There is a structural deficit today of over $3 billion per year that if left unaddressed will continue to grow. There is a backlog of unpaid bills and debt associated with it that exceeds $15 billion. In addition there is a built-in multi-billion-dollar deficit of funding for schools and universities and human services that most families rely upon.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,For the sake of argument let's agree that there's at least a need to address the structural deficit with enough to pay off the backlog over several years. We are talking about billions of dollars each year to fill the hole in our future budgets.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"There are, in essence, three alternative options for fixing this problem:"
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"First, we could choose only to cut state government spending and raise no revenue. To do that, we have to recognize that out of this year's $39 billion budget, approximately $20 billion is required payments on our debt, on our pensions, on our court-ordered obligations or federally protected programs. That leaves approximately $19 billion dollars. That's the money we spend educating our children, running our colleges and universities, keeping our streets safe, preserving our natural resources, getting people to and from work efficiently and caring for our veterans. We'll call that ""discretionary spending."" To balance the budget by simply cutting government, we would have to reduce discretionary spending on all these direct services our jobs, our families and our businesses rely on by approximately 15%. That's 15% fewer state police, 15% fewer students going to college, 15% fewer working parents receiving child care assistance, and 15% less money for your local schools – which likely also means your local property taxes will increase. I should point out that this option was tried in the prior administration, and it failed - because nearly no one thinks it's a good idea to force our most talented kids to leave the state by diminishing Illinois colleges and universities, drive families away by defunding local schools, make our communities less safe by reducing public safety, and increase poverty by cutting badly needed human services."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Our second option is to raise revenue with our current regressive flat income tax system and impose more flat taxes which fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class. This option could require imposing sales taxes on services, implementing a retirement tax, or raising the income tax overall by around 20%. Or all of the above. For a family earning $100,000, that means paying almost a thousand dollars more in income taxes, and their property taxes will continue their upward march as they always have."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Our third option is to reject imposing additional income, retirement and sales taxes on the middle class and instead enact a fair income tax. This would lift some of the tax burden off of middle income earners and instead ask the wealthiest to pay a little more. Just for clarity, a fair tax is what three quarters of states with income taxes have. We can accomplish this with a more competitive rate structure than Wisconsin and Iowa, both of which are outpacing Illinois in job creation and economic growth. We can also implement a fair tax system that's lower than our metropolitan competitors on the east and west coasts."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Make no bones about it, I choose to stand up for working families and will lead the charge to finally enact a fair tax system in Illinois."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Ultimately, our chief responsibility to the people of Illinois is to set this state on a path to sustainable growth with an income tax system that is fair. It is not fair that I pay the same tax rate as a teacher, a child care worker, a police officer or a nurse. And efforts to simply increase the income tax rate across the board fuels further income inequality and kicks the can down the road for our children and grandchildren to solve our ongoing budget issues. The state needs a fair tax, and I am going to be relentless in pursuing one over the next two years."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"My office intends to immediately begin negotiations over proposed fair tax rates with leaders from the House and Senate. Conversations and debate about rate structures and how much revenue we need to raise are appropriate. I expect different opinions and viewpoints over the best way to achieve an equitable tax system, and I sincerely welcome that conversation. I have already asked a few legislators who oppose the fair tax to offer their best ideas to improve it, and I am confident they will come to the table in good faith."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,What is not appropriate is a small collection of the wealthiest people thinking that they should drown out millions of lower and middle income Illinoisans unfairly burdened by the current flat tax system.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Now, I understand that I am an unlikely proponent for this much needed change. But perhaps the fact that the heaviest burdens would fall on taxpayers like myself under a new fair tax system will convince many of you that I am proposing this path forward because I truly believe it's what is best for Illinois."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"To fix our state's problems, we need fundamental tax reform. There's no hiding from it. There's no running from it. There's no lying about it. I choose a fair tax system to get us out of this mess."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"It will take 18 months to get it done, but it's worth the wait so we can save working families hundreds or thousands of dollars per year."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,A fair tax will change the arc of Illinois' finances forever.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Until then, this proposed budget serves as a bridge to a stable fiscal future."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Which is why I am proposing a fiscal year 2020 budget with re-prioritized and controlled spending that targets increases in three key areas that will help our state thrive and grow: education, health and human services, and public safety – investments in people that I believe will pay dividends down the road. This is a constrained budget – more austere than I would like – but I think it's important that we be disciplined and focused over the next few years to pay down our bill backlog and the debt left over from prior administrations."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"The responsible course of action is to embrace some near term reasonable – and realistic – new revenue, which will bring in an estimated $1.1 billion in total."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Let's begin with this: By legalizing and regulating adult-use cannabis in this legislative session, we will create jobs and bring in $170 million in licensing and other fees in fiscal year 2020. I have noted many times that I don't view this issue through a purely financial lens. I think we should take this action for our state because of the beneficial criminal and social justice implications and the jobs it will create. And let's be honest, like it or not, cannabis is readily available right now. I would rather the state tax it and regulate it than deny the reality of its use and accessibility."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"This budget also includes the legalization and taxation of sports betting. Expansion of gambling is a perennial effort in this state, and often these proposals get bogged down in regional disputes and a Christmas tree approach. But in those instances, we were talking about adding more riverboats or adding into other regions. Sports betting is different – this is a new market created by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. Every day we argue about ""who's in and who's out"" is money that goes to other states and to the black market. I am calling on the legislature to take this up immediately so that Illinois can realize hundreds of millions of dollars, create new jobs, and bring sports betting into a regulated environment that will protect citizens from bad actors. If we do it this year and become the first state in the Midwest to move on this initiative, we can realize more than $200 million from sports betting fees and taxes in FY 2020."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I am also proposing that Illinois enact a tax on insurance companies, specifically a managed care organization assessment to help cover the costs of the State's Medicaid program – something that Leader Greg Harris has championed for many years and that has been enacted in other states. This would be structured to generate approximately $390 million in revenue to cover a portion of the state's Medicaid costs. This would be a smart way to increase our federal match."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Bringing efficiencies to state government in addition to these new revenues is not enough for Illinois to reach firm fiscal footing. We must address our pension liabilities. Throughout my campaign I said that we must pay the pensions that are owed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that. And therefore that is what we must do. So I am proposing a responsible approach to our pensions that does not crowd out all the other investments we must make so that Illinois is a state that thrives."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Twenty-five years ago, when the pension payment schedule was put in place, the well-intentioned architects of it predicted that in fiscal year 2020 we would spend $4.9 billion on pensions. Instead, the bill today is $9.1 billion. Nearly double. This must not continue. We must put the system on a more sustainable path – one that preserves pensions for the retirees that earned them, and at the same time allows us to grow our economy and grow our way out of the pension liability."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"And last week, my administration put forward a 5-point program to do just that. We will dedicate a portion of the new fair income tax – in other words, hundreds of millions of dollars – to the pension system, over and above our required pension payments. We will infuse new assets into the system up front. We will manage our debt through a small-scale pension bond used entirely for reducing our liability. We will make the optional retiree buyout program permanent. And we will smooth the pension ramp by modestly extending it."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,This approach is not one that can be looked at as a menu from which to pick one and discard the rest. There's no room for that any more. We must attack our pension liability from many angles all at once. And we must be consistent and persistent in this battle.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,Some will criticize this approach. There are those who will say that retirees should lose the benefits they earned. The Supreme Court has made it clear that that is illegal. There are others who would raise taxes on middle class families today. I say middle class families have paid enough.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I promised to be honest about our challenges and solutions. This is the most responsible, sustainable and balanced approach to dealing with a problem that was decades in the making and will take years to solve."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Ultimately, the fair tax must be part of the long term solution to our pensions."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"There are many education, healthcare and job creation initiatives that I think are well worth funding and many opportunities for investments across the state that I talked about during my campaign. But state government today can only do so much, and without a commitment to reaching firm fiscal ground, we will soon be able to do even less. My highest priorities are stabilizing state government, growing our economy, and protecting working families."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"For our fiscal and economic health, we must start with a sustained effort to restore and improve our education system."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I have been advocating for large investments in early childhood education for decades, long before I became governor. Real focus on the learning that happens from birth to age 5 can determine the entire arc of a person's life. Investing in early childhood is the single most important education policy decision government can make, and it has proven to provide a significant return on investment. That's why I'm proposing funding the Early Childhood Block Grant at $594 million, an increase of $100 million from fiscal year 2019. It will allow us to begin the march toward universal preschool so that every child in Illinois will have a real opportunity to succeed."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I have also focused on reversing the damage done to higher education by the budget impasse. College affordability is a paramount investment in near term economic growth for our state. So I've proposed a 5 percent increase for public universities and community colleges, as well as an increase in the Monetary Award Program by $50 million to help more than 15,000 more low- and moderate-income students attend college next year. We will do more every year to come. I'm also proposing $35 million for the second-year costs of the AIM HIGH merit scholarship program for high achieving students – so we can keep our best and brightest in Illinois."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"On a smaller scale, I am consistently looking to maintain or increase funding for programs that have an outsized benefit to the economy for traditionally neglected communities. Along those lines, this budget includes funding for the Advanced Placement Low-Income Test Fee Waiver. The $94 it costs to take an AP History exam is a huge burden for a low-income family. We must be ever mindful of how we as a society inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of poverty and the ways, both large and small, that we can help people find a way out."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"In my inaugural address I said that I would not balance a budget on the backs of the starving, the sick and the suffering, and I keep that promise today by beginning to rebuild health and human services."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"We increase the income eligibility threshold in the Child Care Assistance Program which will give quality care to approximately 10,000 more children. We provide funding to open the new 200-bed Chicago Veterans' Home, long delayed by the budget impasse. We will be able to hire an additional 126 direct service staff for DCFS to protect children. We will provide funding to help investigate cases of kids' exposure to lead – this is important, because we have raised our standards to be more aggressive. This budget adds funds for community-based violence interruption, homelessness prevention, behavioral health, mental health, addiction, dementia, and Alzheimer's."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,This is less than what I would like to do. But it is what we can afford to do in year one of our recovery.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"As another part of my plan to strengthen working families, we are giving 1.4 million Illinoisans a raise."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,Our country is engaged in a serious conversation about income inequality right now. I think that's long overdue. There was a time where we operated with a general philosophy that workers should be able to afford the goods and services that they help to produce. That's not some outdated notion. It's fundamentally American.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,Many of you asked me why I made passing a $15 minimum wage an immediate priority given all the challenges our state faces right now.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"The current minimum wage is $8.25 an hour – which means even if you are working full time every week out of the year, you are making $17,000 a year. You can't send your kids to college on $17,000 a year. You can't afford a single health emergency, or pay for any of the things that might prevent a health emergency. You can't sustain child care on $17,000 a year. And you can't save for retirement. A flat tire or a worn car battery is a genuine fiscal emergency that might also threaten your job. And one paycheck is often the only firewall against homelessness."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,The current minimum wage is a lifetime sentence to poverty.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Whether you live in Chicago or Cairo, I find that unacceptable, and I worked with the appropriate amount of haste to change it. When your house is burning down, you don't wait for the rain to put out the fire."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"I said I would put Springfield back on the side of working families, and I meant it."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Finally, we will do more to keep our neighbors safe in the state of Illinois. This begins with making sure the Illinois State Police can be rebuilt, with two new cadet classes to replenish their dwindling ranks. We will pay for the gun dealer licensing law that I was proud to sign during my first week in office, to take a reasonable step to end the scourge of gun violence in too many of our neighborhoods. We will take a more rigorous approach to getting guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them in the first place. I'm committed to advocating for commonsense gun laws, and I'm committed to making sure that we are implementing the laws we already have on the books more effectively. These investments have taken on an even greater importance since the massacre in Aurora, which serves as a poignant and painful reminder of the work that still remains."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Every governor deals with their share of trials, tumult and tribulation."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,I mentioned at the beginning of this speech that Henry Horner took office in 1933 at the start of the worst decade of economic decline in US history.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Horner was good friends with Carl Sandburg. They shared a love of all things related to President Lincoln. In the later years of his life, Sandburg granted an interview about his friend Governor Horner, in which he said, ""Horner was the real goods…he got to high places without selling his soul."""
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Indeed, despite all the economic struggles the state faced during the Great Depression, Horner still managed to increase school funding, institute unemployment insurance and pensions for older Illinoisans, create building programs for state institutions and improve public health services."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"He understood that prosperity doesn't trickle down, it trickles up. When we lift up those who have the least, our boats all rise together."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Horner was a fundamentally optimistic man. He approached his job as governor with a hopeful heart, and he never let that hope diminish under the uncommon burdens of being head of state."
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,He knew what I know that the state of our state has always been strong because of the values of our people not the value of our coffers.
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Horner once said: ""The only way to carry out any great purpose is not on your shoulders, but in your heart. Carry it on your backs and it may wear you down. Carry it in your hearts and it will lift you up. Thus, the heart strengthens the purpose, and the purpose gives poise and inspiration to the will."""
Illinois,JB Pritzer,Democrat,"Like you, I carry the burdens of this state in my heart – and despite the heavy load it lifts me up every day. I share my purpose with you so that it may give poise and inspiration to our collective will – because I know the road ahead is hard, but I think it's about time we all walk it together."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Madam Chief Justice, Lt. Governor, members of the General Assembly, my fellow Hoosiers."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,It is indeed an honor to stand before you for the third time to discuss the state of our state and the work we'll do to make life better for all Hoosiers.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I can tell you this much. It doesnt get old.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,For I know just how fortunate we are to occupy our respective offices and to therefore have the opportunity and duty to make a positive impact on people's lives and the state we all love.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"That's why I'm pleased to report that, thanks to the energy and hard work of Hoosiers from Angola to New Harmony, from Henryville to Hammond, Indiana is on a roll and the state of our state is strong!"
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,There are more Hoosiers working today than at any time in our state's history.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,Our labor participation rate remains higher than the national average while our unemployment rate is lower – lower than any state we touch.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We've tripled the foreign direct investment in our state over the last three years, and we've broken records two years running now for new job commitments coming our way."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Statewide tourism is up, wages are up, in-migration is up, home sales are hot, building permits have surged, and our tech ecosystem is growing."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"As important as these facts are now, we're planting seeds to ensure that Indiana's harvest will be bountiful for years to come!"
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,This two-part mission – making the lives of Hoosiers better today while building for the future – has been and will remain my administration's focus.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,My aim – to coin a phrase – is to take Indiana to the Next Level.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,This isn't a slogan on a billboard or bumper sticker to me. It's an action-oriented aspiration that Indiana can be one of the leading states in the country by any measure.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"To achieve it, we must bring the same strength and vitality to our quality of life that we have to our economy. So tonight, I'll dig a little deeper into what I mean by ""the next level"" and what it will take for us to get there."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Because when I think back to not so many years ago, when our ""ship of state"" was taking on water fast, when our economy was weak and narrowly focused, when we had no reserves and we were outspending our revenue year after year, we were dead in the water."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But thanks to you and our predecessors, we turned Indiana 180 degrees and set sail on a course to sustainable growth, fiscal strength and a more efficient government."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Thanks to this continuity, Indiana has been transformed from having one of the worst financial conditions of any state to now having one of the best."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Now, I chose to focus on ""cultivating a strong and diverse economy"" as the first pillar of my ongoing agenda because the first step to the next level must be a vibrant, growing economy. If our private sector isn't doing well, then surely our public sector will be first to be strained."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,That's why we can't stop now.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Global connectivity, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and non-stop technological advances are permanent features of the future of work, workers and the work place. And that offers an exciting way forward to those who embrace change as an ally, not as an adversary."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We simply cannot just maintain our course. Instead, we must throttle up."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Two years ago, we burst off the starting line and kept the pedal to the metal ever since."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We've operated within an honestly balanced budget, protected our Triple-A credit rating, and set aside nearly $2 billion in our state's savings account."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We've been ranked best in the Midwest, a top five state in the nation for doing business, and number one for small business."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But to stay ahead of our competition and keep breaking those jobs records, we must keep sharpening our economic development tools to give us the flexibility to attract more capital investment and more people to locate here."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"So, yes, I will once again pursue exempting military pensions from our state income taxes so we can attract and retain talented patriotic veterans – who we know are some of the most experienced, focused and loyal workers anywhere."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Speaking of veterans, we are fortunate to have a few heroes with us this evening."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"In April, the Navy christened the fourth USS Indianapolis. The second ship of that name was lost at sea in 1945. The new vessel will be used for mine-clearing and anti-surface warfare."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"That ship will join the new USS Indiana, the most modern, sophisticated, fast-attack Virginia-class submarine in the world – longer than a football field and capable of 25 knots when submerged. For those of you Googling right now, that's 28.77 miles-per-hour. Pretty fast for a football-field-long boat under water."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,You'll be especially pleased to know the sailors on board the USS Indiana are officially called Hoosiers.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, please help me recognize two great Americans: Commander Colin Kane of the Indianapolis and Commander David Grogan of the Indiana. Sirs, we salute you and your crews."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We are justifiably proud of our Hoosier connections to those who defend our nation. Let their service inspire us to reach for that next level when it comes to our quality of life, education and workforce pursuits."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Because, just as with our economic gains, we will not reach our destination in these other critical areas without changing our past ways."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But when we set the right course to steer by, we will make progress here every day."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,And that's precisely the role and goal of the other four pillars I introduced two years ago.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"For example, we're making real progress building and rebuilding our infrastructure – something that's essential for us to remain the undisputed Crossroads of America."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We're accelerating regional road projects like completing I-69 three years ahead of schedule. We're pursuing transformational rail projects in northwest Indiana, a fourth water port in southeast Indiana, and we're working to make Indianapolis the Midwest destination for nonstop international flights."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But we're about more than ports, planes, trains and automobiles. The internet is just as essential to our prosperity today as highways were a century ago, and we have far too many Hoosiers without access to affordable high-speed broadband."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"When I was visiting one of our towns, someone said to me, ""Eric, if you come by our Starbucks between 7 and 9 at night, you'll see parents with their kids doing their homework, because they can't get wi-fi at home."""
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Another Hoosier told me, ""Kids in my town go to McDonalds to go online."""
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Nothing against large coffees and Big Macs. I'm a fan of both. But all students should be doing their homework at home. So, we're making the largest single investment in broadband in our state ever."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"To help more people enjoy the diverse outdoor beauty of Indiana, we're also making the single largest investment in our state's history to expand our hiking, biking and riding trails. Because we all know that today, people often choose where to live before they choose where to work, and these amenities matter."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"And to that point, reaching the next level requires strengthening our human infrastructure."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Last year, I said that developing a 21st century workforce is the defining issue of the decade. Nothing has changed my opinion or my focus on building a Hoosier workforce that can outcompete anyone, anywhere, any day."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Our efforts and investments are designed to meet the goal of ensuring 60 percent of Hoosier adults have a high-value credential beyond high school. To do that, we must get our kids to start thinking about their career paths earlier in their lives. So we will introduce every student to career and apprenticeship options in Indiana's key opportunity industries."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We'll support students who seek a four-year degree and those who don't, so that everyone has a pathway to a fulfilling career."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Earlier this year, I met a trailblazer who is doing just that: Mary Roberson, the superintendent of Perry Central Community Schools."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Perry Central is a small school, all grades K-12 under one roof, nestled in the middle of the Hoosier National Forest. Through partnerships with local manufacturers like Jasper Engines and Waupaca Foundry, they've created a business on the school grounds."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Students get hands-on experience in advanced manufacturing, product research and development, and also learn soft skills like a good work ethic. The kids learn and earn money. Their parents are delighted. Jasper Engines and Waupaca help students further their education and train potential employees."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"When we talked, Mary insisted, ""Our kids can be just as successful as anybody,"" and she's proving it. Thank you, Superintendent Roberson!"
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,A strong economy depends on a world-class workforce. That workforce depends on a great education. A great education depends on great teachers.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I'll bet everyone here had a teacher who had a profound impact on your life. I've had several. I've come to appreciate and respect them more and more each day.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,And one way to attract and retain more of those teachers is to make teacher pay more competitive.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"In my budget proposal last week, I requested K-12 education funding increases of 2 percent for the next two years. That's a 4 percent increase and equates to $432 million more than today."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,But we can and we must do more.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,We're in a financial position to use surplus dollars to pay off a pension liability that local schools currently pay.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Just like paying off your mortgage frees up money in your personal budget, this state investment will save all local schools $140 million over the biennium with continued savings thereafter."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,These two proposals would result in $572 million new dollars to K-12 schools over the biennium.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I believe local school districts should allocate 100 percent of the $140 million to increasing teacher paychecks.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"That's what we'll be doing to make an immediate impact. And over the long term, I am creating the Next Level Teacher Pay Commission – chaired by Hoosier businessman and community leader Michael L. Smith – to identify resources that can be made available to make sure our teacher compensation is competitive with neighboring Midwestern states and ready to act on by the 2021 legislative session."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Once again, Indiana will show the way we solve challenging issues together."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Along with improving K-12 education, we must also skill up and re-skill our adult population."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"The good news is that we're making encouraging progress. From 2016 to 2017, Indiana's post-high school credential attainment rate grew at nearly double the national growth average and even faster among Hoosiers between 25 to 44 years old."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,The number of Hoosiers with a STEM-related bachelor's degree also grew a healthy 8 percent.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But we can and must do more here, too, which is where our Next Level Jobs program comes in."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"In 2018, nearly 9,000 Hoosiers enrolled in Workforce Ready-eligible certificate programs. Another 17,000 who previously started college came back to finish their post-secondary educations."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,That's why we'll expand our Workforce Ready Grant program to continue our push to get more adults to complete degrees or certificates in high-demand industries.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"And that's why we'll double the funding for the Employer Training Grant, which provides financial support to Indiana companies to hire, train and retain Hoosier adults to fill our job openings."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Last October, we announced that the Markle Foundation, along with Microsoft, made Indiana only the second state in the country to land its Skillful program, which helps connect Hoosiers to fulfilling careers. They said they chose Indiana because we're doing, not talking."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Given the urgency around strengthening our workforce, we can't afford to overlook anyone, especially those who want to earn a second chance."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"In 2018, we began enrolling Department of Correction offenders in programs to train them for high-wage, high-demand jobs – everything from welding to computer coding."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"I said last year we'd graduate 1,000 by 2020 and we're already there, a year ahead of schedule."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We became the first state outside of California to introduce a new program called The Last Mile into our prisons. Its founders, Chris Redlitz and Beverly Parenti, are here with us tonight."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"In less than a year, we already have coding programs in two of our facilities, and Google.org recently announced it would invest $2 million into this proven program that has a zero percent recidivism rate. And thanks to Steve and Cathy Simon, we'll soon be announcing further expansion. Chris and Beverly, Steve and Cathy, thank you all for believing in Indiana."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I also attended the first graduation of a different workforce program. This one at the Madison Correctional Facility.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"The graduation speaker was a young woman named Brittany, who had been in prison for five years."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"While there, she got training in welding and manufacturing, got the skills she needed, and got a job. That's enabled her to move into her own home and she's now helping her seventh grade nephew and her mom. And one year into her new career, she's earned a promotion. If I had to guess, the first of many."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"The best thing, Brittany told us. She said, ""I get to wake up every day not looking at bars but looking at family!"""
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,Brittany is paying it both forward and back a generation.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Brittany, will you please stand up, so we can stand for you?"
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"I'll tell you another group I'm not giving up on. In fact, we will continue to put our full force behind attacking the drug epidemic throughout our state because, ladies and gentlemen, we'remaking progress."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Our new 2-1-1 OpenBeds program has made more than 4,000 referrals for treatment services and support groups, connecting people quicker than ever, which can mean the difference between life and death."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"The number of opioid prescriptions is down, communities are forming their own systems of care, and we are getting drug data faster and more accurately than ever before. But better data means we have more information about the extent of the issue, and it shows we still have a long way to go."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"To get there, this year we'll improve access to quality treatment, expand recovery housing, and provide better services for pregnant women who are substance dependent."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,We will keep working 24-7-365 to get more of our Hoosier neighbors on the road to recovery.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"We'll continue to be transparent and accountable on pressing issues like child welfare, infant mortality and student safety."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Last spring, I convened a group to examine school safety and the resulting report led to recommendations that will enhance mental health services in schools, provide more funding for safety equipment, and require active shooter training and threat assessments in our schools, because that is the world we live in now."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,We are putting all of our efforts into implementing this entire plan.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"But I have heard from Hoosiers who say we need to do more, and I agree."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Several pieces of legislation related to school safety have been introduced, and I look forward to working with you all, with moms and dads, and schools, as the days ahead unfold."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you tonight proud of the progress we're making in our Department of Child Services."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"A year ago we had just started a top-to-bottom review of DCS. Now, we are moving full speed ahead on addressing all those 20 recommendations that not only protect children but recognize the difficult work of those who protect them."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"It's still early, but the investments we've made to increase caseworker salaries and improve the workforce culture are making a difference. The ratio of supervisors to case managers has improved, so there is more time for supportive supervision and coaching. Turnover among frontline staff is down and retention is up, which means more stability between caseworkers and the families they work with. And fewer children are re-entering the DCS system after their cases close."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Now is not the time to pull back resources, right when we're starting to see such progress."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"I also challenged our social service agencies to become the best state in the Midwest for infant mortality by 2024, a tall order considering where we've started."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"You all approved our ""Levels of Care"" program to assure that the highest-risk babies are delivered at hospitals with the right facilities to meet the needs of moms and infants."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,Now we're seeking to implement two more programs that aim directly at reducing infant mortality: A navigator program to help guide high-risk pregnant women and a program to verbally screen all expecting mothers for substance use disorder so those who need it will be connected to treatment.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"These are the kinds of efforts it will take to get more babies to celebrate their first birthdays, regardless of their zip codes."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Finally, we will not slow our efforts to modernize state government to better serve our citizens and businesses alike. But, truly serving all our citizens requires more than increasing our efficiency."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,Indiana is one of five states that does not yet have a bias crimes law. It's time for us to move off that list.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I look forward to working with the General Assembly to achieve this goal so that our state law reflects what's already in my administration's employment policy.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Businesses interested in Indiana care about this issue, but it's not just about business. At heart, this has to do with people's dignity and how we treat one another."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Standing strong against targeted violence motivated to instill fear against an entire group is the right thing to do. So let's strengthen our state laws by ensuring judges can sentence more severely when a group is targeted, even though there may be only one actual victim."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"With your help, and only with your help, we can do this."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Now I said earlier that a strong economy is essential to determining our desired destiny. To truly reach the next level, our quality of life must be equally strong."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,You can see a good example of both just off I-65 in northwest Indiana at Fair Oaks Farms.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Over the past 50 years, Mike and Sue McCloskey went from running small dairies in California to bigger dairies in New Mexico. When they wanted to expand their business, they chose Indiana because our prime location enabled them to reach the most customers."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Today, Fair Oaks has 30,000 cows and is recognized as the sustainability leader in the U.S. dairy industry."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,They also transform their cow manure into power for their farms and trucks and have started building affordable housing for their growing workforce.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Mike says this success couldn't have happened anywhere else. He said, ""I gotta tell you, there's no better state to work in than Indiana."""
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Mike and Sue, thank you for planting a field of dreams in Indiana."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"So, we have business innovators who could have gone anywhere, but chose Indiana as their launch pad because we occupy the best location in the nation, core to shore."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"They stayed in Indiana because rather than hold them back with high taxes and regulations, we cheer on their success."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"They're turning a profit, contributing to their community and they never stop thinking about ways to convert have-nots into haves."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Whether it's businesses like Fair Oaks Farms or Forest River, Genesys or Infosys, Lilly or Indiana Limestone."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Whether it's people like Mike and Sue, Chris and Beverly, Steve and Cathy, Mary or Brittany."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,Or whether it's commanders and sailors in places we'll never know.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,"Hoosiers across Indiana and beyond are leading our state into the future – the Indiana way – growing glo-cally and finding creative ways to make lives better, and in the process, taking Indiana to the next level."
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,I'm going to focus every day on supporting them and steering our great state onward and upward.
Indiana,Eric Holcomb,Republican,May God continue to bless you and our great state!
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, legislative leaders, Senators and Representatives, justices and judges, elected officials, distinguished guests, family, friends, and my fellow Iowans."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Each time I enter this spectacular building, I am reminded of the generations of Iowans who have come before us. And each time I walk into this historic chamber, I am humbled by the responsibility of following in the footsteps of some amazing leaders and outstanding public servants."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,We lost a number of those leaders last year. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Most notable for us today is Chief Justice Mark Cady, whose absence is felt right there in the front row. He loved his state. And he loved the law. To his family and colleagues in the Iowa Judicial Branch, our entire state shares your loss."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We also bid farewell to former Lt. Governor Joann Zimmerman, the first woman elected Lt. Governor of this great State. She brought the heart of a nurse and the passion of a mother to a distinguished career in public service. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"And with shared sadness we mourn the loss of Congressman Berkley Bedell, and former Iowa Supreme Court justices Daryl Hecht, and Bruce Snell, as well as the longest-serving Chief Justice in state history, Art McGivern. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,We honor those leaders—and so many more—who committed their lives to making tomorrow a little better than today.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"So often public service comes with sacrifice. A sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make each day. Our military, police, and first responders risk their lives to protect ours, and so today—and every day—we should thank those who serve and honor those we’ve lost. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,In 2019 we saw the resilience of Iowans tested once again as historic floods ravaged both sides of our state and parts in between. Entire communities were wiped out as the waters rose and didn’t seem to recede. But that devastation was met with purpose and resolve to rebuild and recover.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"To those whose lives have been impacted, your state stands with you as we work to return life to normal and get your homes, businesses, and communities back on track. To do that, the budget I’m submitting today includes an additional $20 million for flood relief. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"This is the third time I’ve stood before you to report on the Condition of the State. As always, it’s a time to reflect on what we’ve done over the last year and to lay out a vision for the year to come. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"But this year marks the beginning of a new decade, so it seems appropriate that we take stock in what we’ve accomplished the last 10 years. And more important, to talk about what we want for the next 10—and beyond. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"When this body met in January 2010, our unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. Our state faced a near billion-dollar deficit. School funding was drastically cut and Iowans were worried about their future. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"A decade later, the condition of our state is truly strong. Because of the vision and tenacity of Iowans, our unemployment rate has gone from a near-record high to a record low. Instead of cutting school budgets, we’re cutting taxes. Our cash reserves are full, wages are going up, and Iowans once again believe we’re headed in the right direction. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Because we have such a great story to tell, this year we launched the “This is Iowa” campaign. The goal is to show the country what we have to offer. To show that Iowa is the best place to live, work, and raise a family."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"As part of this new initiative, we created a candid-camera style video where an actor, playing a real-estate agent, shows Iowa house listings to New Yorkers. When the couples hear how big the homes are, how short the commute is, and what they can buy the properties for, they’re baffled. “That’s not possible,” is their general reaction. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"When the actor tells them that these homes are in Iowa, not New York, they’re shocked and amazed. That’s not how they envisioned Iowa. That’s not what they’ve been told. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,We made that video to dispel some of the misconceptions and to showcase what we have. But I think the video serves another purpose: It reminds us what we have. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,Because it can be easy to forget—forget what it means to grow up in a safe neighborhood with a good school and a nice backyard. To spend more time with our families than we do in traffic. And to watch the sun set in our big skies and the stars shine over our beautiful fields. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,That’s what Iowa has to offer—and so much more. Those New Yorkers saw what I see: That opportunity lives here. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"But we cannot take it for granted. If we do, if we become complacent, then the condition of the state will not be strong when this body gathers 10 years from now. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"That’s why this year, 2020, we need to plan for 2030. For 2040. We need to seize the opportunities that exist so that years from now, the next generation of Iowans will inherit an Iowa whose greatness comes as no surprise to anyone, including New Yorkers. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"That kind of planning takes work. It doesn’t happen all at once, and no single policy will do. But that kind of planning also takes a bold vision. A vision that preserves our heritage while seizing our opportunities. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,My request to this General Assembly is that you join me in taking the first bold step. Right now. This session. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In the coming weeks, I will introduce the Invest in Iowa Act, a bill that will:"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"significantly cut income taxes, "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"create a sustainable funding source for our mental health system,"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"reduce the burden of property taxpayers, and"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"fund the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust,"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,These changes will make our vision a reality. It’s an investment in our future. And it’s an investment in those who are our future. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Ten years ago, Iowans voted to establish the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust. Funding that trust is no small investment, but I believe it’s one we need to make. We were given this beautiful land to work but also to keep. And preserving what we’ve been given must be a responsibility of all Iowans.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In 2010, the legislature established a formula for distributing the Trust Fund. I voted for that formula, as did every one of my colleagues. But the challenges we face today and will face tomorrow are different than what we understood them to be 10 years ago, so it’s time to amend the formula. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Specifically, we need to increase the amount of money that will be allocated for water quality and conservation. Under my bill, almost 58% of the Trust Fund, an estimated $100 million, will go toward water-quality efforts every year, representing an almost 31% increase in current funding. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We will also commit $52 million for other conservation and outdoor recreation efforts, representing an increase of 14.6% of current funding."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"These investments will not only aid our conservation efforts, they will improve our quality of life and help us retain and recruit a new generation of Iowans. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I have no interest in raising taxes, so any increase in revenue from a sales tax must be more than offset by additional tax cuts. That starts with continuing to reduce our uncompetitive income-tax rates. Two years ago, thanks to many of you in this room, we passed the largest income-tax cut in Iowa history. I said then, and I’ve said ever since: that wasn’t a one-and-done."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I intend to make good on that promise, which is why I’m proposing to cut income taxes by an additional 10 percent for almost every Iowan, with lower-income Iowans receiving as much as a 25 percent cut next year. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Let me put that into perspective. Just one year ago, our top tax bracket was at almost 9 percent, one of the worst in the country. Now, with this new round of tax cuts, our top rate will be down to 5.5 percent by 2023—significant progress that will make Iowa competitive with our peers. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Mental health is becoming one of the biggest challenges of our time. Two years ago, we reformed our adult mental health system, and last year we created Iowa’s first children’s mental health system—important steps to putting Iowans on a path to wellness.      "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We must now provide predictable funding. To date, property taxpayers have supplied most of that support, through their county to the local mental-health regions. I’m proposing, through the Invest in Iowa Act, that we reduce property tax levies and provide the needed funding through the State general fund. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"No parent, family member, or friend should be told that treatment isn’t available for their loved one. By establishing a dedicated and stable fund for mental health, we will give hope to so many who are suffering in silence. It’s a promise we’ve made, and it’s a promise I intend to keep. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"The Invest in Iowa Act will bring meaningful change to Iowans in the very first year. But most important, it looks to the future. To our children and theirs. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"If we take this bold step, right now, then whoever is standing at this podium in 10, 20, or 30 years—Republican or Democrat—can proudly say what I can say today: The condition of our State is strong."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"When I look to the next decade, I’m reminded of what Will Rogers once said, “the farmer has to be an optimist, or he wouldn’t still be a farmer.”  From weather at home to markets overseas, to bureaucratic decisions made in Washington DC, so much of our farmers’ success hinges on factors seemingly out of their control. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"But that doesn’t mean we simply sit back and hope someone else fights for our interests. It’s up to us to shape the challenges of uncertainty into opportunities for growth. I will always be a relentless advocate for our farmers, producers, and our way of life. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Which is why today I’m calling for an additional $2 million for the Renewable Fuels Infrastructure Program, as well as modernizing and expanding the E-15 Plus Promotion Tax Credit. This will support the sale of E-15 year round and drive domestic demand for our homegrown renewable fuels. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"As we begin 2020, I’m focused on the overall wellness of all Iowans, in every part of the State, in all stages of life. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"And when I say all stages of life, I mean to include the unborn. We must protect life by making clear, through an amendment, that our constitution does not grant a right to abortion. It’s time, and unfortunately it’s necessary.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We must also do more to promote and support maternal health. Fewer doctors and fewer hospitals are delivering babies and providing care for mothers, especially outside our urban areas."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,That’s why I’m taking steps to increase the number of doctors who are willing and able to provide OB services in all four corners of our state. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"First, I am proposing a fellowship for new family-practice physicians who want to train and specialize in OB care. Each year, four new residents will complete the fellowship program and head back to their local communities, taking with them connections to OB specialists and an expertise to better treat mothers and their babies. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Second, we’re launching a tele-mentoring system where OBs at our best institutions can consult with physicians across the State. With this program, a doctor in Corydon can talk with a specialist in Iowa City about treatment for a mother with a high-risk pregnancy."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Using technology to bring cutting edge health care into every community is no longer a dream. Telehealth is reality today but we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface. This year, my budget includes additional funding to expand the use of these services to underserved Iowans. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I’ve also directed the Department of Human Services to remove barriers that are restricting schools from partnering with telehealth providers, especially for behavioral health. What used to be a 70-mile drive in the middle of the school day can now be a walk down the hall. That means more children will receive the care they need, with less disruption to their education."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"These advances are not possible without high-speed broadband. After unanimous support from this legislature, last year the Empower Rural Iowa Act provided $5 million that is now helping to fund 17 broadband projects in rural Iowa. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Broadband is not a luxury; it’s critical infrastructure. From the farmer checking crop conditions to the Main Street business participating in the 24/7 marketplace, connectivity should be the expectation no matter where you live. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Let’s make that expectation a reality. Today, I’m requesting that we appropriate an additional $15 million and adjust our state match so we can continue to leverage private and federal funding to build out broadband to every part of Iowa, making us the most connected state in the nation."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Broadband also supports our world-class education system. And if there’s something Iowans have always understood, it’s that there is no better path to opportunity than a quality education. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We have strong local control, rooted in communities and parents who care deeply about educating their children. We have the highest high-school graduation rate in the country and more high-schoolers taking college courses than any other state. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We’ve made remarkable progress in recent years on putting a new focus on STEM—and opening doors in elementary, middle, and high schools for students to explore fields that will best equip them to be the innovators who build tomorrow’s economy."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,Computer science has quickly moved from a narrow elective to a basic skill that every student needs.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,That’s something the people at Osage Community Schools understand and have embraced with a passion. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In addition to requiring computer science for students to graduate, they have dramatically increased learning opportunities for K-12 students to explore coding and design apps or find their passion in the world of technology. And, through an innovative partnership with NewBoCo in Cedar Rapids, Osage is training teachers to better integrate computer science in subjects like math, English and art."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,I want to recognize Osage and NewBoCo for their vision and congratulate the students for their success.  You are a model for our state and the nation. Please stand.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"What Osage is doing is amazing, and we need more of it."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Currently, almost two-thirds of school districts teach computer science in middle and high school. And about half teach it in elementary school. We need that to be 100 percent—which is why I’m calling on the Legislature to take computer science statewide and ensure every student, at every level, has access to this new basic skill."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"One of the best ways for students to learn is through hands-on experience, which is why we’re making Iowa a leader in work-based learning. In the last year alone, we’ve expanded high-school registered apprenticeships and launched the work-based learning clearinghouse, and this year will be adding $1 million for work-based learning coordinators to be covered by operational-sharing agreements. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Momentum for this initiative is building across the state. Council Bluffs is a great example. The school district, Iowa Western Community College, and several local businesses have partnered to create TradeWorks Academy, where high-school students work with professionals to experience what it’s like to have a career as a plumber, electrician, or mechanic. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,It’s a win-win for the students and the community. The students learn skills that lead to life-long careers. And local businesses get the workforce they so desperately need.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Emma Myers, a junior, is using TradeWorks to learn about welding. That’s what her dad has been doing for 40 years, and she wants to follow in his footsteps. By the time she graduates high school, she will have a welding certificate that can immediately lead to a job right there in Council Bluffs.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,I want to recognize Emma and a number of folks here today from TradeWorks. Thank you for your leadership.  
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In 2019, we made historic investments in K-12 education, with over $90 million in new money, including an increase in per-pupil funding and transportation equity. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"The budget I’m presenting to you today makes another historic investment, with over $103 million in new funding so that Iowa schools can maintain the best teachers and classrooms in the world. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"When it comes to workforce opportunities, Iowa is in a strong position. We have thousands of open jobs in rewarding careers. That’s why we launched Future Ready Iowa. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Three years after starting the initiative, and just one year after this body overwhelmingly voted to approve funding, Iowans who are looking for a way up are finding that opportunity. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Over 6,000 Iowans are already receiving the Last Dollar Scholarship, almost 80 percent of which are adult learners. That’s 6,000 Iowans who are on their way to a rewarding career.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Take Sarah Keehn, a 35-year-old mother of six from Hampton who was laid off. Because of the Last Dollar Scholarship, she is now at NIACC pursuing a medical-assistant degree, and soon she will help fill the shortage of workers in the healthcare industry. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Zach Behrensmeyer from New Liberty is another great example. He assumed college was something he couldn’t afford, but the Last Dollar Scholarship has enabled and encouraged him to pursue a degree in computer-software development at Kirkwood. When Zach graduates this spring he’ll leave school with a highly marketable degree in a field where the average starting salary is $55,000."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Sarah and Zach, please stand to be recognized."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Through the Employer Innovation Fund, Future Ready Iowa is also working to spur innovation among employers and communities in addressing their workforce needs. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In Muscatine, the local community foundation partnered with Eastern Iowa Community College to create an intensive six-week program for low-income parents who have children in school. They’re working to become welders or certified-nursing assistants and, if they stay on track through the program, a job will be waiting for them at the end. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"On the other side of the state, Peterbilt of Sioux City and Midwest Diesel Tech Academy developed a new training program to meet the increasing demand for diesel mechanics in the area. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In Oskaloosa, the school district recognized transportation as a major barrier for students to attend career academies at Indian Hills Community College, so they developed a transportation program to make it happen."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"With all three of these and more, the State of Iowa, through the Employer Innovation Fund, was a partner. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"In less than a year, we have helped thousands of Iowans upskill for the new economy. Future Ready Iowa is working, which is why I’m proposing that we expand the Last Dollar Scholarship and the Employer Innovation Fund by $2.8 million each, bringing the total investment to over $20 million.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Future Ready Iowa will infuse Iowa’s workforce with thousands of skilled employees, providing much needed support to our growing businesses. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,Childcare is the next workforce issue we need to tackle. It’s another barrier for families looking for a way up.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"For some, it’s about affordability; for others, access is the issue; and for thousands of Iowans, it’s both. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,This year we need to act. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"First, let’s make childcare more affordable by expanding Early Childhood tax credits. Currently, they are available to families making $45,000 or less; I’m recommending that be doubled to $90,000."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Second, we must begin to address the child-care cliff so we are not punishing parents as they continue on a path to self-sufficiency. To do this, we should implement a tiered co-pay system that doesn’t punish those who work hard enough to earn a raise.  "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Finally, we need to enlist Iowans to find common-sense solutions that increase access to childcare."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Consider Lee Container. It’s a manufacturing facility in Centerville that employs 200 people. Since opening its doors in 2008, they have expanded but were struggling to find workers. Lack of childcare was part of the problem, so Lee Container partnered with a local provider to turn a vacant elementary school into a daycare center."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"That’s exactly the kind of innovation we need, which is why I’m opening the Employer Innovation Fund to employers and community organizations that have ideas to expand and create childcare options in their communities."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I want to recognize Robert, the CEO of Lee Container, and Michelle from Curious Kids who are with us to today. Thank you for inspiring this great idea."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I’ve made it a priority of this administration to focus on prisoner re-entry and rehabilitation, because our prisons shouldn’t be one stop in a circle that leads back to prison. Those in our correctional facilities are serving time for a reason, but when they leave, we want them to succeed. Because here’s the thing: If they re-offend, they land back in prison, at a cost to taxpayers of $32,000 per year."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"But it’s more than that. When someone has lost their way, we’re called to seek them out — to leave the 99 to find the one. I believe in that calling, which is why I formed the Governor’s FOCUS Committee on Criminal Justice Reform."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"This committee, which is chaired by the Lt. Gov., includes law enforcement, corrections officials, the NAACP, and a wide range of stakeholders. Last month, they provided several recommendations, and we are already in the process of implementing many of them."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Last year, I signed legislation that protects employers who are willing to give returning citizens a second chance. To build on that, we hosted roundtables at our correctional facilities in Mitchellville and Rockwell City where more than 80 employers stepped inside our prison walls—and maybe a little outside their comfort zone—to learn how they can meet their workforce needs and give an Iowan a second chance at a productive and rewarding life. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Finally, I am renewing my support to amend our Constitution so that it no longer bars felons from voting after they’ve served their sentence. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"To see why that matters, talk to William Burt from Waterloo. He spent much of his life in and out of prison, but is now a business owner who is working to change Iowa law to allow mobile barber shops—which I think is a good idea. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,I recently called William to tell him that I was restoring his voting rights. Hearing those words brought tears to his eyes. You can’t imagine the gratitude and dignity that Iowans like William feel when they’re told they can once again exercise what Ronald Reagan called “the crown jewel of American liberties.”
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"William, please rise so that we can recognize your efforts to be an active and productive citizen of this great State. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"I am grateful to the House for starting this process last year by approving the constitutional amendment with a strong bipartisan vote of 95 to two.  I also appreciate the productive conversations we are having with Senators, and I look forward to continuing to work with you to pass the amendment and craft an implementing statute that lets us avoid the confusion and lawsuits that have plagued other states’ restoration efforts. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Together, we can help put returning citizens on a path to redemption. We can help them become productive members of society, reduce recidivism, and make our communities a safer place. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Opportunity lives here because of the ingenuity of our people. If Iowa is going to thrive in the next decade, we must make sure that government isn’t stifling that ingenuity."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,I’m concerned we are. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"One quarter of Iowa’s workforce requires some kind of professional license. If that sounds like a lot, that’s because it is. It’s the second highest in the nation, which puts our state and its people at a competitive disadvantage. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"A recent study shows that our licensing system cost Iowa 48,000 jobs and $290 million. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Our licensing requirements are also the worst for low-income people, meaning that those who need opportunity the most have the hardest time getting a license."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"We should never dismiss the importance of protecting the health and safety of the people, but it’s been far too long since we’ve modernized our licensing structure. That’s what I’m asking you to do today. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"First, we need to adopt universal licensing recognition. Those who go through a rigorous application process in another state, and meet certain conditions in our state, should be able to have that license recognized here. Let’s encourage these skilled workers to move to Iowa. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Second, we should waive license fees for low-income individuals. That doesn’t mean we lower any standards. It just ensures that we don’t deny someone a professional license simply because of their inability to pay. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Third, we currently have no uniform standard for considering criminal convictions in licensure. As a result, qualified and skilled Iowans are being denied the chance to obtain a license because of mistakes unrelated to the profession they now want to enter. This is another barrier to ex-offenders reentering the workforce and we need to change it. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Lastly, we need better oversight of the entire professional-licensing process. I’m calling for the creation of a commission that will, every four years, review every professional license requirement and the boards that oversee them."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Licensing reform is a topic that has bipartisan support, but that doesn’t mean it will be easy. There will always be entrenched interests who benefit from overly burdensome regulations. But we can’t let those interests stand in the way of opportunity. These reforms are long overdue, and this is the year we will begin to fix a broken system. "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"As we head into this legislative session, let’s not focus solely on the next 12 months. This is a time to chart the path for the next ten years. To stand together to enact a comprehensive agenda that:"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"invests in Iowa, "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,returns money to taxpayers
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"preserves our land and water, "
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"strengthens our schools,"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"looks after the health and well-being of all Iowans,"
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,and gives every Iowan the opportunity to succeed. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"So as we move into the next decade, let’s put Iowans first. Let’s be bold and visionary."
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,Let’s seize this opportunity and make the next decade Iowa’s best.
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,It’s time to show the world that Opportunity Lives Here. 
Iowa,Kim Reynolds,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of Iowa."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Mr. Speaker, Madam President, Chief Justice, Members of the Supreme Court, Members of the Legislature, Honored Guests, and my Fellow Kansans:"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,What a profound honor to stand before you tonight to offer a vision for the state we all love.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"In the east gallery, I’m joined by the man I often joke about as “my long-suffering husband,” Ted Daughety. But he truly has been a pillar of support for me and my daughters for over 30 years – and especially the last 13 months."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Our daughters, Kathleen and Molly, were here earlier this week."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Every time I see them, I’m reminded of why Ted and I made our home in Kansas over three decades ago. What a wise decision that was. The upbringing we were able to give our daughters in this magnificent state helped mold them into two remarkable individuals."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"I’m very proud of them – and the strong, talented women they have become."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"My partner on this journey, Lieutenant Governor Lynn Rogers, is here with his wife Kris. Kansans will be hard pressed to find a more energetic, big-hearted, dedicated lieutenant governor. Lynn will be a true asset to our state as he works to cultivate growth in rural Kansas."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,I’m also thrilled to welcome members of my new Cabinet.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"From the beginning, I committed to building a strong, diverse, dynamic group to rebuild our state. You’ll recognize both Democrats and Republicans, women and men, a mix of seasoned veterans and fresh faces, all with a love for Kansas and a sincere desire to serve. And I thank them for their willingness to take on these new challenges."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"And to the Kansas Legislature: welcome back! It’s wonderful to see so many old friends and also so many new leaders. I know I’m in a new role, but I want to maintain my working relationship with you. We are all in this together, we’ve got to be pulling in the same direction. There’s so much at stake. And I look forward to working with you."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"It has been quite a week. I’m not usually one for ceremonial fanfare, but I’ve treasured every minute. From the day of service to the inauguration on the capitol steps to this incredibly surreal moment."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,But I’m also ready to get to work.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"My message to you this evening is both constitutionally-mandated and a time-honored tradition. Of course, the personalities and dynamics shift over time, but the backdrop, and the fundamental tasks at hand, never change."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"I am here, as your governor, to offer a blueprint for the year ahead. You are here, as lawmakers, to enact a budget. This has been done 157 times before."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Yet, something feels different tonight."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"After a decade of crises – starting with the Great Recession, followed by a self-inflicted budget catastrophe – we found ourselves at a turning point. We were at times weary, frustrated and, sadly, untrusting of one another."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"But, in the end, it came down to a fundamental question. We had to ask, what is Kansas worth?"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"This was not just a matter of dollars and cents. It forced us to re-examine some of our most deeply- held convictions, and it was a painful process."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"But as problems piled up, we had to accept reality. In 2017, we defied the odds, acknowledged the mistake, and hit “reset” in a historic act of bipartisanship."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,That is what it means to be a Kansan.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Regardless of our state’s partisan breakdown, our crowning achievements have always been won on the middle ground."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Now, tonight we will start a new chapter. We must unite around the values we share … we must always remember that the people who sent us here expect compromise and results."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,But we must also strike a delicate balance in the days ahead. It will require an acknowledgement of the entire Kansas story. Not just one fiscal year or one moment in time.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"It is with this renewed sense of purpose, appreciation for our past struggles, and optimism for our next chapter that I proudly report:"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,The state of our state is improving.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"2019 offers an unmatched opportunity for Kansas to continue its upward climb. But for our fragile recovery to continue, we must resist running to our partisan corners. We must keep our eyes fixed on the task at hand – and the job we were elected to do."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,And all of that begins at the heart of our communities – in our public schools.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Just a few weeks ago, a story in the newspaper caught my eye. It was about a young man named Braxton Moral. He will graduate from Ulysses High School and Harvard University. That’s right, Harvard, this year at the tender age of 16. He will graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in government, and a minor in English. All while he is still in high school right here in Kansas."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,And he has big plans after graduation – he is looking ahead to law school.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Braxton is obviously a uniquely talented student. But he also reminds us of what young people will accomplish when given the opportunity. Braxton is here today with his family in the east gallery – I ask you to join me in recognizing this amazing young Kansan.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Students like Braxton exemplify the transformative power of our public schools. A place where all Kansas children who strive can reach their potential and overcome any obstacle, no matter where they come from."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"But only if we, as elected leaders hold up our end of the bargain."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Unfortunately, throughout Kansas’ decades-long debate over school funding, we’ve fallen into a troubling pattern. It begins with a promise from elected leaders to fund our schools. Then a failure to follow through on that promise."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"That is going to change this year. This year, we will end this cycle of litigation and meet the needs of our students and teachers once and for all."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,The days of doing the bare minimum to fund our schools are over. It stops now.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Remember, just a few short years ago, schools closed early because they literally could not afford to stay open. Test scores dropped for the first time in a decade. Class sizes grew – some with more than 30 kids in a single classroom."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Superintendents and principals struggled to hold their districts together, often taking on multiple roles like counselor or bus driver. Sometimes they even refused to be paid, just to keep their budgets above water."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Teachers fled the state. And those who stayed received an average salary that ranked 42nd in the nation.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,The consequences were tangible and the scars are lasting.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Never again.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"We’re going to properly fund our schools this year. And next year. And the year after that. Every year, every month, every day that I’m governor."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,And we’re going to make sure our schools prepare our children for a changing economy. Modern classrooms with modern technologies.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Because at the end of the day, we need our children to graduate high school or college or technical school so they can find jobs right here in Kansas. So they can stay here and raise their families close to home."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"When I began work on the state’s budget last month, this was the very first decision I made. Budgets reflect our priorities, and my number one priority will always be our public schools."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Now I’m calling on lawmakers to act on my proposal with equal urgency.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"To assist in the effort, I separated education funding from the rest of the budget. This will provide a vehicle for you to consider the matter cleanly and quickly."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"My friends, we have debated this issue in these halls, in the courts of law, and in the court of public opinion. Kansans flocked to the polls in record numbers last year to send a message about this issue specifically. Now, we must listen to them – our families, our teachers, our business leaders."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"We have a deadline to meet, so let’s get this done. If we act decisively, we can all share in a bipartisan victory."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Because I assure you, we face plenty of other urgent problems – especially in our rural communities."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"This past July, I put forth a detailed plan to address the challenges facing rural Kansas. The majority of our 105 counties lost population last year and for many years prior to that. And whether it’s roads, broadband, housing, or agriculture – they need our support."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Speaker Ryckman and Representative Hineman, thank you for recognizing this important challenge and creating a new committee to focus significant time and energy on this issue. We look forward to partnering with you and the committee members."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Lt. Governor Lynn Rogers – along with our new Secretary of Commerce, David Toland, will head up this effort on behalf of my administration."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"In the coming days, we will build an interconnected, strategic plan for rural economic development that leverages our communities’ unique assets. That means developing infrastructure. Addressing the shortage of affordable housing and supporting agribusiness."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,We’re going to cherish our rural and small-town way of life – and we’re going to make sure that rural Kansans can get the support they need to thrive.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,One more important way we do that… by expanding Medicaid.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Just two weeks ago – on December 31st – Mercy Hospital in Fort Scott closed its doors after more than 100 years in the community. This followed the closure of the hospital in Independence in 2015.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Now the folks of Bourbon County will have to travel long distances for emergency care, to give birth, or just to get tests done."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"According to some reports, 30% of our state’s hospitals are considered financially vulnerable. In small communities across our state – these facilities are at serious risk of closure."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Rural communities cannot survive without hospitals and affordable healthcare. Period.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Young families, seniors, Kansans who suffer from chronic illness, Kansans who just want to stay healthy — no one can afford to risk their safety and wellbeing by living in a community without access to healthcare."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Just by expanding KanCare – the state’s Medicaid program – we can help keep these important facilities stay open and provide affordable health care to 150,000 more Kansans – no matter where they live."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,I’ve made no secret that expanding this program is one of my top priorities. And 77% of Kansans agree with me.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"To date, our failure to act has cost Kansas over $3 billion in federal funding. That’s 3 billion in tax dollars we’ve paid to the federal government that has gone to benefit other states. It’s $3 billion that could have helped save Kansas lives, Kansas hospitals, and Kansas communities."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Instead, we sent it to states like Iowa, Colorado, Indiana, and Arkansas or one of the 32 other states that have already expanded Medicaid."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Child advocates support Medicaid expansion as a means of keeping vulnerable parents healthy. If low-income Moms and Dads can afford treatment for mental health, substance abuse, or just everyday preventive care, they can take better care of their children, and perhaps we can keep these kids in their own homes and out of our foster care system."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Senator Jerry Moran recently noted that rural hospitals are – and I quote – hanging on by a thread – end quote. And he agreed that expanding Medicaid could help them.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"And just last fall, Governor Jeff Colyer’s Task Force to Address Substance Abuse Disorders and the opioid crisis also recommended expansion to ease the unsustainable burden on our hospitals and criminal justice system."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"We’ve seen Republican and Democratic led states across the country find consensus on this issue to benefit their citizens, their communities and their economies."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"For all these reasons and so many more, tomorrow’s budget will pave the way for Medicaid expansion."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Next week, I will announce a bipartisan working group to finalize a path forward. By Kansas Day, there will be a plan to expand Medicaid put before the Kansas Legislature."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"I can imagine no better way to celebrate our state’s 158th birthday than by embracing a policy that will make every Kansas community healthier, stronger, and more secure. Please join me in this effort."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"And finally, another critical challenge we must address immediately. A moral crisis in Kansas that troubles me every day. And sadly, it is a matter of life and death."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Our foster care system is at a crisis point. It requires immediate and considerable attention.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,This is an issue I have been working on since I graduated from high school. I worked with troubled teens and children struggling with mental illness. It has been a lifelong mission to help our most vulnerable – and often forgotten – children.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"In the last few years, nothing has made me more angry than the callous disregard some agency leaders demonstrated towards our vulnerable children and their families. The incompetence and lack of transparency we witnessed in committee hearings 18 months ago … made national news. And it put a spotlight on this reprehensible crisis."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Last year, when I found out 70 foster children were missing – I was beside myself. Not only that, the secretary at the time didn’t seem bothered by the revelation. But I demanded answers. And together with colleagues and advocates, we demanded change."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"In the last year, the Child Welfare Task Force has done great work studying the problems and working towards accountability. But there was only so much we could do without full cooperation and transparency."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"The number of Kansas children in foster care has skyrocketed – up 45% since 2011. We’ve seen the programs, charged with helping families, overwhelmed by the sheer numbers in need. And the caseloads of dedicated social workers are absurdly high – making it challenging to provide the services needed by our most vulnerable children and their families."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"There is not an easy answer. But we must do what we can to protect our kids. This is an emergency. These are our children in our communities facing abuse, neglect and worse. Let’s remember Evan Brewer… Jayla Haag… Mekhi Boone. And many more who needed our help. These were our children… in our communities. And I refuse to forget them."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,We must fix this now.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"My budget provides funding for the Families First Prevention Services Act, a landmark piece of legislation approved by Congress last year. It will inject millions into efforts that strengthen vulnerable families and prevent children from entering the foster care system."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"My budget includes funding to hire more, qualified social workers and reduce their caseloads. We will restore funding cuts to our prized Children’s Initiatives Fund, where we know our investments have the greatest impact on our youngest children."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,We will prioritize SCHIP – the State Children’s Health Insurance Program – to accommodate federal changes so that low-income Kansas children don’t lose their access to healthcare.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Finally, working in partnership with my new Department for Children and Families Secretary, Laura Howard, we will rebuild an agency decimated by ideology and mismanagement. In November of last year, I said that “in order to fix something, you have to know what’s going on. You have to be able to get under the hood, see what is working and what is not.”"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,My team is already at work – and we will be transparent about what we find and we will make it right.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,I know that each of you is committed to protecting all God’s children. And that begins with our most needy. I ask you to join me with this fight.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Tonight, I’ve laid out a few of our priorities for Kansas. We must restore funding to Kansas schools and end the cycle of litigation."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"We must expand Medicaid so we can create jobs, keep our tax dollars in Kansas, save our rural communities, and protect our most economically fragile families."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,We must fix our broken foster care system and do absolutely everything in our power to ensure that our most vulnerable children are protected from neglect and violence.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Yet, there are so many things we haven’t discussed. Our crumbling roads and bridges. Public safety. Higher education. Mental health. Meeting the demands of our rapidly changing economy. I could go on and on. And I know many of you are worried I will…"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,But this is just the beginning.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Tomorrow morning, my budget director, and your former colleague, Larry Campbell, will walk you through the details of my first state budget recommendation – delivered three weeks ahead of the statutory deadline."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"And later this week, I will convene my first official cabinet meeting, during which time I will instruct each member to complete a thorough audit of her or his respective agency – so we can increase effectiveness and efficiency. And we can eliminate waste and improve transparency by ending “no-bid” contracts"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,But we have one more thing to cover tonight. And it brings us back to where we started.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Those breathtaking years of crisis have left Kansas on the brink of collapse. Kansas lost more revenue in the first year of the Brownback tax plan alone than we lost in the entire Great Recession.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"While the time for finger pointing is over, we’re not off the hook for the long-term consequences of past policy decisions."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,I’m proud to honor my promise to balance the budget without raising taxes.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"If we are going to succeed, I need your help to protect both sides of the budget equation until our fiscal health stabilizes. As many of you have already said, we must show restraint. Because ultimately, we do not know what lies ahead."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Kansas has endured two historic national recessions in the last 20 years.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Another recession will soon be upon us. It’s not a question of “if”. It’s a question of “when” and “how bad.” Unlike the last two record-setting downturns, Kansas finds itself now completely unprepared. We have no margin for error."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"That is why we must be cautious, conservative and fiscally responsible. We must live within our means. Prioritize what matters most. Always look for ways to save. And always make sure our children come first."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,And we must work together to write this new chapter – as Kansans.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve worked with all of you. As governor, that will continue. My door will be open. I will listen."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"But, I was elected to rebuild our state. And I take that responsibility very seriously. Kansans want us to work together to make our state better. To provide more opportunities for our"
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"children. To grow our economy. To make it possible for our rural communities to thrive again. And as your governor, I plan to do just that. That means cooperation, compromise, and bipartisanship."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,No one person – not even the governor – can act alone to achieve consensus. That’s the whole point… working together.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"And in that spirit, I’ll promise you this: I will do everything in my power to set the right tone. I will listen every day … to leaders from both parties and to the people of this state."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,We’ll take the best ideas no matter where they come from – and we’ll work together.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"It won’t be easy. We all know we have a very long, challenging road ahead of us."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"These past eight years have been a hardship, no doubt about it."
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,But we’re united by a common set of values. That spirit of neighbor-helping-neighbor. Respect for one another. And always doing right by our children.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Those are the values that brought my family here more than three decades ago. And they are the values that will guide me as your governor.
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,Kansans are no stranger to hardship or hard work. We don’t want things handed to us. We don’t expect life to be easy. That raw grit – our fierce determination – is part of our history. It makes us who we are. And if we work together… if we put partisanship aside and Kansas families first….
Kansas,Laura Kelly,Democrat,"Then we can truly live up to our motto, Ad Astra Per Aspera."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the General Assembly, Lt. Governor Coleman and Chris O’Bryan, constitutional officers, our Kentucky Supreme Court, invited guests, Kentucky’s First Lady Britainy Beshear, my children Will and Lila— and, most especially, all of our Kentucky families watching at home."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Here we are.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Convened in this auspicious chamber, together."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Rural and urban.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Legislative, executive, and judicial."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Democrat and Republican.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Northern, central, eastern and western Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We are all here, together tonight, on Team Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And because of that, I am proud to report to you tonight that the state of our commonwealth is strong, coming together, and ready to face our challenges."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We are all here, together, with an opportunity to fulfill the promise that is Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,That’s the promise of a better life for all of our families.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Let’s examine what that means.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,A better life for our families requires an obligation by all of us to focus on the challenges facing our communities in every part of this commonwealth.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It means committing ourselves to action — not just talk — on public education so that every child gets a chance.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It means that access to health care is a pressing need that every family faces.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"That the opioid epidemic must be addressed with compassion and real-world solutions,"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"That there are far too many Kentucky moms and dads working two, three, four jobs just to try to scrape together the monthly budget, all while their bills go up but their wages stay the same."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It means that every child who has to go to school hungry, or is in foster care or who is trying to learn algebra and history while reeling from domestic violence at home is an urgent, critical priority for each of us in this room today."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It means that we must turn the lost, the lonely, and the left behind into the found, the friended, and a meaningful part of Team Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"When I think of the challenges that we Kentuckians face, I am reminded of 1st Peter Chapter 4, verse 10 which tells us “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We are each here blessed to be able to serve.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,But that comes with a special responsibility.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,That responsibility has been laid out everywhere from the bible to pop culture.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Luke 12:48 it states: ""For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required,"""
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Similarly, the wisdom from Uncle Ben that launched a superhero franchise is – “With great power comes great responsibility”"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"To those in this chamber, much has been given, so much is expected."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And the power to govern, to change laws and to change lives, is a great power, which comes with great responsibility."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We, in this capital and around Kentucky, are responsible for using the power and privilege of office to do right by Kentuckians, to focus our energy not on partisan squabbles but on working together to figure out how to better the commonwealth we all love so dearly."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And let me be clear: every moment we focus on partisanship, every moment we focus on national divisions, we fail to address the reality before us."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It is a reality where we are the third poorest state by per capita income.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Where 22% of our children live in poverty.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Where we are in the top eight of states in terms of hunger.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Where we have some of the highest child abuse and neglect rates in the country.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Where we lose more of our brothers and sisters to opioid overdoses than all but a handful of other devastated states.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Where a recent ranking had us 45th in the country for adults with high school diplomas.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Where we are in the top 10 in lung cancer, diabetes and heart disease."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And where we incarcerate our own people at one of the highest rates in this country and in this world.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Now don’t get me wrong, I believe Kentucky has a lot going for it and that the state of our commonwealth is strong."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"But there are so many needs, so many in crisis, too many families crying out for help."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,There is simply not enough time or enough bandwidth to solve these problems if we play partisan games.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Because those games separate and divide us, which leaves us alone."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And that is not how we do things as Kentucky.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Think about the ice storm in 2009. There are dozens of stories about the National Guard going door to door in hard hit areas, expecting to find people alone and in the cold. Instead, they saw neighbors helping neighbors – a fallen tree on someone’s property was met by a half-dozen Kentuckians with chainsaws."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And anywhere there was power, there were extension cords leading to the next house."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Think about our military and guardsmen and women who are stationed around the world. These brave men and women, many of whom have dangerous assignments, count on each other."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Their unit, their ability to work together is the key for not only their success, but coming home, safe, to their families."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Let’s take a moment to recognize all of those Kentuckians serving in our armed forces, and protecting this commonwealth and this country"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"So today, we still need each other to survive, but we also need each other to thrive."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Because we can’t do that alone, either."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Thurgood Marshall once said, “None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody … bent down and helped us pick up our boots.”"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"I grew up in a Kentucky where my family, teachers, mentors and friends all bent down and helped me pick up my boots."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And I have seen firsthand what lifting up the boots of even one generation can do for every generation that comes after.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"See, I am the proud grandson of a Baptist preacher named Orlando Russell Beshear from western Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,He and my grandmother worked hard every day of their lives to make sure my dad and his brother and sisters could become the first generation to attend college in the Beshear family.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"My grandparents, and the teachers of Dawson Springs public school system, helped pick up those boots."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,My dad Steve Beshear is with us tonight along with my mom Jane Beshear. I am so proud of them and their service to this commonwealth.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"They show you that the change in just one generation, his generation, changes everything for the generations to come."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I see it in my kids. That they now have more opportunity because a community picked up that man’s boots in the 1960s.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,That’s the promise of our commonwealth.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"That by breaking one cycle of poverty, by providing one person a high school or college degree they never dreamed they can achieve, we can forever – and for the better – change the trajectory of our people."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Today thousands of Kentucky children and adults need us to realize this promise.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,They need us to help pick up their boots.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It may be help going to see a doctor through K-CHIP, the children’s health care program, or expanded Medicaid."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It may be the meals provided in public school or the coat provided by FRYSCKy - our Family Resource and Youth Services Centers.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It may be stepping in to stop abuse and neglect.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Right here and right now, we have a can’t-miss opportunity to make major, widespread progress. So we have to take on the big challenges, not do what is politically safe."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It’s what our people deserve. It’s what we were elected to do.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"In our first month in office, my administration took immediate action:"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"I restored voting rights to more than 140,000 Kentuckians that had committed nonviolent felonies."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,My faith teaches me the value of redemption and these are thousands of our neighbors who served their time and should have the opportunity to become part of our democratic process again.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"I will never forget that day. Rynn Young had lost his right to vote at 18 – he’d never voted in his life. He’d served his time, become a productive citizen. But he could not take his twin 16-month old girls to the polls to show them the importance of voting."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Now, he can. After signing the executive order restoring his and other rights, I handed him the pen. The look on his face was something I will always remember."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,But he and so many others deserve more. It’s time to pass a constitutional amendment that automatically restores voting rights to non-violent offenders that complete their sentences.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Days after restoring voting rights, I rescinded the Medicaid waiver that would have kicked more than a hundred thousand Kentuckians off of their health care."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Access to health care is a basic human right and it will be protected during my administration. We can’t expect to create the work force of the future if our people aren’t healthy.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,My administration further stopped $8 billion in managed care contracts that were rushed through just days before I took office.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"The government contract review committee, made up of legislators in this room, unanimously recommended the contract be terminated, because these contracts should be subject to a process that the people of Kentucky have confidence in."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Last week, in what may have seen like a small step to some, the Lt Governor and I announced that we would waive the GED testing fee for anyone who couldn’t afford it."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Already, we are seeing major response from those that realize a high school degree or GED can change their life and the next generations of their family."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And I have been intentional about building an inclusive cabinet that reflects the people of Kentucky and who will represent their interests.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Diversity isn’t a buzz word or a metric. It’s a value. It makes us a better government and makes our state more attractive to investment.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We’re making so much progress already and I will bring this same energy and dedication each and every day of my term.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Because we have so much more to do.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,What I am focused on is the WHERE we are going. It’s a simple acronym that encompasses our Team Kentucky agenda.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,W is for Wages. For far too many families the bills are going up while incomes are stagnant.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,H is for Health care. We can’t sit back while prescription drug prices soar and access to health care remains under attack.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,E is for Education. Public education has the power to transform lives. It will be prioritized under my administration.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"R is for Retirement. A pension is a promise and should be treated as such. We owe so much to our educators, social workers, first responders and public servants."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,The last E is for Example. I am committed to changing the tone in Frankfort because we have so much more in common than what divides us.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,This is our obligation. To make sure that every action we take in this capitol building helps our people.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It means our economic approach must be grounded in creating good-paying, family-supporting jobs across our commonwealth, and not just increasing corporate profits."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And that those good jobs must pay a woman the same as they would a man. In 2020, it’s time equal work results in equal pay."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We have so much to offer in Kentucky: unparalleled natural beauty, a workforce of educators and health care providers who go to work every day to do right by their neighbors, farmers who wake up early and work late grow our food, miners who continue to work underground to provide for their families, business owners who run the diners and shops that make up the main streets of our communities, and dads and moms who work second and third shifts at our factories to make ends meet."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,These are the people that I think about every day. These are the people that should be at the forefront of the decisions we make in this building.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"That is why it is my mission, and it should be our mission, to work to transform our economy to become an international leader in the industries of the future, starting with agriculture technology."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"I want to take a moment to give credit where credit is due, the last administration landed an amazing agri-tech project in AppHarvest, and its founder Jonathan Webb."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Jonathan, who is here today, is building what will be the largest greenhouse in North America. He’s going to employ nearly 300 Kentuckians, and he’s doing it in eastern Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,But this should just be the start. We have already begun exciting talks on how to build our agri-tech infrastructure with everyone ranging from our Council on Postsecondary Education President Aaron Thompson to an official delegation from the Netherlands.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"To attract the jobs of the future, we must invest in three areas: infrastructure, workforce training, and most importantly, education."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"On infrastructure, we must focus on completing important projects for families across our commonwealth. It means I’m committed to speeding up the Mountain Parkway project in Eastern Kentucky and building the I-69 bridge to open up western Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It also means ensuring that every area of Kentucky has clean drinking water.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Because our families deserve it and new business demands it.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And it means coming together to chart our future to ensure every area of the state has high-speed internet.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We can do this, as Team Kentucky, because every part of our commonwealth matters and every part has an important role to play in making our economy thrive."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I believe in a bigger brighter future.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,That requires that our Kentucky families don’t have to worry about losing health care coverage because of a preexisting condition. I hear members of both parties say those very words.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"So this session, let’s pass a state law ensuring no one can lose coverage in this state, ever again, based on a preexisting condition."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,But that is not enough.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"There are far too many Kentuckians who are right now rationing insulin, or deciding between a prescription drug expense or healthy food, rent or school supplies."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"In fact, a member of this chamber has talked about having to ration insulin himself"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Most bottles of insulin cost just $7 to produce and yet big pharma is charging our people upwards of $300 a vial. It is wrong. It is cruel.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We must fight back.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,There are a number of bills in the legislature right now to curb the costs of insulin.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Representative Danny Bentley, a Republican, and Representative Patti Minter, a Democrat, are sponsoring one such bill. Let’s pass it. The approximately 530,000 diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, in this state are counting on it."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"While we are at it, while we are finding common ground on health care, we should also end surprise medical bills."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Having a loved one in the hospital, going through a procedure, needing emergency services is already hard."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Getting an unexpected $10,000 bill is devastating."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I know nearly everyone here and everyone at home has received one of these bills.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"My story, was receiving a five-figure bill for a procedure and testing my family was told was in network and would be covered."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I know the feeling and the fear that comes with opening those bills.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,So let’s come together and pass a law ending surprise billing in Kentucky.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And then there is our drug epidemic. It’s the challenge of our times.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It continues to tear our families and communities apart.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It takes the lives of people we love and care about.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Which is why I appreciate that Attorney General Daniel Cameron is going to continue our lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Let’s not sugarcoat it. Opioid manufacturers and distributors fueled this crisis.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"They have the blood of our loved ones on their hands, and they must be held responsible and made part of the solution."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We must defeat them.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And when we do, we cannot squander what will be a once in a lifetime chance to move beyond this crisis."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Let’s make a pledge and turn it into law. That every dollar we get from these companies that have wreaked such havoc on our commonwealth should go towards ending the opioid epidemic.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Those steps would be a good start to addressing the health of our people.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"But if we are to fulfill the promise that is Kentucky, the key is education."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It’s no secret that the states that have the highest per capita income, where families make the highest wages, are the most educated states in our country."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And the key to breaking cycles of poverty – that’s education too.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Waiving the GED test fee is a good start.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"But the future, the key to breaking cycles of poverty, of creating a better educated population and of attracting great jobs, or creating better wages and climbing out of the 40s in too many rankings – the key and the solution is in our public schools."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It’s time to come together, all of us, in support of public education."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"This is a new opportunity, a new start with a new governor, where we can all pledge to lift up our communities by supporting and investing in our public schools."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We can wipe the slate clean, and we can move forward in support of public education together."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Investing in our public schools means investing in our teachers.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"These teachers deserve a raise. They are on the front lines of every problem we face as a commonwealth, from family-member addiction, to hunger, to the need for better jobs."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And right now we face a teacher shortage that threatens the education of our children.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,This body has spoken to the need of more engineers and more nurses in this state.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,But how can that happen if we lack full-time science and math teachers.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We’ve figured out how to give tax incentives to corporations—so I know we can figure out how to pay a living wage to the men and women who get up at the crack of dawn every morning to go open their classrooms, stay up late grading papers, and give everything they can so our Kentucky children have every opportunity."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"My commitment started with asking Jacqueline Coleman, our lieutenant governor, to serve as our new secretary of the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"She has graded those papers, stood in that classroom and experienced our teacher shortage firsthand"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,She is going to do a wonderful job
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"My commitment will continue with including an across the board $2,000 raise to our Kentucky teachers in my budget. We can and we must afford it."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Our commitment must continue with keeping our promise and fully funding our pension obligations in that budget, keeping our promise to not just our teachers, but to all public servants."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,A commitment to breaking cycles of poverty must also include higher education.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"In this state, we need more of every option. More graduates with a four-year college degree and more workers with technical degrees and certifications for skilled trades."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"To do that, we must end our historic cuts to our universities and community colleges."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"So stay tuned, because the education first budget that I am constructing will be designed to provide us the opportunity to truly change lives moving forward. And it will embrace higher education."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"A commitment to the future also requires that we create new revenue to meet the growing needs of our state. Right now we are watching more than $500 million dollars in gaming revenue go across the border to states like Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. It’s time to stop that flow. To use that money for our needs."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Representative Adam Koenig has filed a sports betting bill. I fully support it, and we should pass it."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"But that shouldn’t be the end of the conversation. Because now, all of our neighboring states – most all of them Republican led – have embraced expanded gaming, while we are being left behind."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Finally, in this session, we must not just discuss, but we must pass meaningful criminal justice reform."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"In Kentucky, we have one of the highest incarceration rates in the country and in the world."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Our people aren’t more violent, we don’t have more criminals."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We just put more people in our prisons and jails.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And in the upcoming budget, you are seeing that not only hurts our future, but our present. Because the costs of our system skyrocketing while our facilities are crumbling, and taking necessary funds from critical needs like education and health care."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Successful criminal justice reform must do several things.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It must reduce our incarcerated population.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It must decrease recidivism and the revocation of probation and parole.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It must address the racial bias and racism in our justice system.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It must provide meaningful addiction treatment and recovery services.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"It must consolidate, and not expand our state prison institutions."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Other states have done this – and they’ve done it while reducing their crime rates.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We can do this too. And we should do it together.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"We have the power and the responsibility to break the cycle of poverty, addiction and neglect. This should drive our decisions on economic development, on funding for public schools and social services and on health care."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,In just two weeks we will be here again to do the people’s business with a budget address. It will unveil a budget that this administration has put countless hour into.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,One where I believe we have transformed a budget of pain into one of progress.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,One that will help us break cycles of poverty.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,One that will invest in both the safety and education of our children.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"With that type of budget, I know that together we can do big things."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Let’s make sure that politics and partisan rancor don’t get in the way.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"I believe as Helen Keller said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” We are each here as a deliberative body that has an enormous potential to make a positive difference for all of the Kentuckians who sent us here. We work for them."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Let’s show that despite all the cynicism, we can actually get things done for our people. Just think what a message that will send for the state of our politics."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"No matter what circumstances we are born into, we all rely on other people."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"In my inaugural address, I talked about how our founders created not just a state, but a commonwealth."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,A commonwealth for the common good of all Kentuckians.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"That in the very creation of Kentucky, they recognized — no, they demanded — that we come together to serve its people."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"So, can we do it?"
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Can we come together to fulfill the promise of a better life?
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It won’t be easy.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We live in the most divisive times of most of our lives.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Every day, forces try to divide us."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"By saying that if someone is different than you, then they must be feared."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"If they belong to a different religion, political party, or watch a different cable news channel, they must be wrong."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"And we see widespread campaigns of misinformation aimed not just at creating division, but even hate."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And let’s admit it. These attempts at division have been effective.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,We see it on the internet and in our neighborhoods.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Kentuckians unable to talk to each other.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Unwilling to shake each other’s hand.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,So here we are.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Right here, right now with a moment … an opportunity to turn the tide."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,An opportunity to stop the yelling and the name calling. Kentuckians deserve better than the bitterness that divides our politics.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And an opportunity to prove to this commonwealth and this country that we can get this right.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It will take us burying old feuds and healing old wounds.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It will take us not just adopting civility in tone but in practice.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,And doing that alone will be an accomplishment.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"But it takes more than civility to thrive, it will take cooperation."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Winston Churchill once said that courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,Coming together will take that courage to listen. To strive to understand people who may disagree with you.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,It is how we move forward. I know we have more in common than what divides us.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I know that we can do what are entrusted here to do: deliver results for Kentuckians.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,I am honored to serve as your governor. I will serve with honesty and good faith.
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,"Our Kentucky motto is United We Stand, Divided We Fall. I believe that deeply. I look forward to working with all of you and the rest of Team Kentucky."
Kentucky,Andy Beshear,Democrat,God Bless you and God Bless the commonwealth of Kentucky.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the Legislature and distinguished guests:"
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I am honored to join you for the start of what I hope to be our only legislative session this year. We have spent a lot of time together in these chambers over the past 3 ½ years, but because of our willingness to come together and put the people of Louisiana first, our state is finally moving in the right direction."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to speak with you about the recent disturbing fires at four churches across our state. Three of them have been at historically African-American Baptist churches in St. Landry Parish - Mt. Pleasant, St. Mary and Greater Union - and one in Caddo Parish at Vivian United Pentecostal. I’ve been in contact with the pastors of all four churches, and I have directed the State Fire Marshal to aggressively investigate these tragic fires alongside our local and federal law enforcement partners. I want to especially thank State Fire Marshall Butch Browning for his leadership in this investigation."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship. And no one should be concerned that their house of worship would be destroyed."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Right now, there are more questions than answers, but hopefully the investigation will yield information we can share with the public in short order. Until then, I am asking everyone to please join me and Donna in channeling all frustration, fear and anger into prayer and support for the congregations that have lost their churches."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,With that being said…
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,This is going to be a very different speech than you are used to me delivering the opening day of session because the budget crisis that for years held Louisiana hostage is over. What was once a $2 billion budget deficit is now a surplus that will lay a foundation for us to continue to move the state forward.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,You won’t hear me talk about a fiscal cliff.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Funding for higher education is stabilized. TOPS is fully funded. And health care services aren’t on the chopping block.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Together, through partnership rather than partisanship, we restored fiscal stability and put an end to the greatest budget crisis in our state’s history."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I have said before that there is no challenge too great for us to overcome if we work together in good faith, and we have proven that to be true time and time again."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"It wasn’t easy. Hard choices and compromises had to be made. But today, I can stand before you and say that the state of Louisiana is much stronger and in a much better place than we were just a few years ago."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"And our people agree. LSU’s Reilly Center recently released the 2019 Louisiana Survey, which notes that more people think our state is moving in the right direction and fewer think it’s going in the wrong one."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Now, there’s still lots of work to do, but we are putting this state back on a path to more prosperity, more opportunity."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We just recently announced that personal income in Louisiana is the highest it has ever been. That’s more money going directly into the pockets of our workers. At $252 billion, our GDP is the highest it’s ever been. It means that more people are working and our businesses are doing better. It means that the state is producing more than ever before."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"And make no mistake – Louisiana IS open for business. In just the past few years, we’ve landed more than 128 new economic development projects that are resulting in more than 27,000 new jobs, retaining over 21,000 jobs and resulting in over $33 billion in new capital investment."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"This means more people will be going to work for the homegrown companies of Waitr and LHC Group in Lafayette. Up in Monroe, CenturyLink, the only Fortune 200 company headquartered in Louisiana, is extending its commitment to our state through 2025. It means in Baton Rouge, Exxon is investing in a polyolefins plant and that in Shreveport, out-of-state company SuperATV is developing a manufacturing and distribution facility. In New Orleans, it means landing the largest economic development deal in our state’s history with DXC Technology, and in Lake Charles, it means that hundreds of folks are working for Citadel Completions at an aircraft center. In Central Louisiana, it means Hunt Forest Products and its joint-venture partner have opened a state-of-the-art sawmill in LaSalle Parish."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"What’s the secret to this success? An improving economy and an attractive business climate are essential. But the true key to our economic progress is our workforce. When businesses come to Louisiana, they do so because we have the talent to get the job done. This would not be possible without our renewed commitment to funding our top-notch universities and technical colleges. By partnering with local businesses, they are creating a pipeline of talent that fuels both established industries and new emerging industry."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"This is how Louisiana has become a global leader in cybersecurity. I am proud to say that next month, the National Governors Association’s summit on cybersecurity will be hosted in Shreveport-Bossier. It’s the first time since 1975 that the NGA has brought a meeting to our state."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Representatives from all 50 states will be coming here, to Louisiana along the I-20 corridor, to learn about threats to cyber safety and the cutting-edge technology and the workforce being used to combat it."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Another key to having a truly productive workforce is having a healthy workforce.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Medicaid expansion is saving lives. Because of expansion, about 480,000 low income people now have health insurance. Nearly 65,000 women have received mammograms. 35,000 adults have had colonoscopies. Expansion is also helping with two of our nation’s most critical health challenges. 31,000 of our citizens have received treatment for substance abuse. And nearly 100,000 individuals have received mental health services. Expansion has cut the number of uninsured in half. We’re generating $3.5 billion in economic activity every year."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"What’s more, employment in the healthcare sector is at a record high. While other states that did not expand Medicaid are seeing rural hospitals close, Louisiana has not had a single rural hospital shutdown over the past four years. In fact, Louisiana has led the nation in the growth of community health centers. For thousands of Louisianans, having access to a hospital or health care facility is the difference between life and death."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Even in our larger cities, access to affordable care is crucial, which is why I prioritized bringing an emergency room back to North Baton Rouge and ensuring that the LSU medical school and University Hospital in Shreveport have been stabilized and strengthened."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,True measure of success is not in the dollars we’ve saved but the lives we’ve made better.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,One of those individuals with a better life is here today. Her name is Elayne English.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"For many years Elayne, who is a college graduate, was gainfully employed, until the bottom fell out of the economy in 2009. She was struggling and had to pull money out of her retirement to pay for her $1000-per month medication."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"But Elayne’s story doesn’t end there. While seeking treatment for substance abuse, Elayne filled out the paperwork for Medicaid. And, under the Medicaid Expansion, she was able to get coverage and get her life back on track. She is working and on her way to becoming a paralegal."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Elayne’s story is about second chances and taking responsibility for yourself. It’s about getting back up when life knocks you down. She credits a strong support team with helping her to get to where she is today. I am proud of Elayne and I proud that Medicaid could be part of that support team.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Elayne, could you please stand up to be recognized?"
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Expansion is not the only way we’ve improved access to care. I want to take a moment to point something out…Session after session, the halls of the Capitol were filled with a sea of yellow t-shirts, symbolizing parents and children whose livelihoods depend on waiver services."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Those yellow T-shirts reminded us that a 10-year wait for services was not care. And I want you to know something.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We saw you, we heard you, and we acted to end the waiting list for developmental disability waiver services after 25 long years."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"To the parents and advocates, while you may be able to retire your yellow shirts, I know we can still count on you to be here fighting on behalf of citizens living with disabilities and helping us to create a more inclusive Louisiana."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Ending the waiting list is a reminder that the greatest responsibility we have is to care for Louisiana’s children, OUR children."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We have taken many steps to ensure the well-being of our most precious natural resource. This is an issue that our First Lady, and my wife Donna, has worked especially hard on, and I am so proud of the difference she is making for children throughout our state."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Working with Secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services Marketa Walters and her committed staff, for the third year in a row, we have broken the record for the number of children adopted out of foster care."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We have revolutionized our approach to foster care through the Quality Parenting Initiative, and we have taken steps to extend the age of foster care to 21 so that young people aren’t automatically forced out when they turn 18, like the 150 who aged out last year."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"As all of you know, I am strongly committed to protecting human life, but no matter your position on the issue of abortion, we should all be able to agree that reducing the number of abortions in this state is a good thing. I am proud to say that abortions are at a 10 year low in Louisiana."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Also, we’ve established the toughest laws against human trafficking in the nation and have made huge progress in prevention as well as the way we treat victims."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"More law enforcement officers and people in our communities are becoming educated about identifying victims. When they see something they say something, which is exactly what we want to happen. That’s what it will take to stop the traffickers and rescue the victims."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Earlier I spoke of what we can accomplish when we come together to achieve a common goal.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"From fixing the budget to passing historic criminal justice reform, we have proven that we are at our strongest when we work together regardless of party to put Louisiana first."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"The truest example of this, however, came three years ago when Louisiana was hit with not one but two devastating floods. No one can question the resiliency of the people of Louisiana. Our willingness to help one another in times of need is unparalleled."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Another prime example of working together is our securing federal funding for the Comite River Diversion Project, which had been in limbo for 30 years. This would not have been possible without a unified effort from local, state, and federal officials. I especially want to thank our Congressional delegation."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"The folks over at CPRA have been hard at work securing funding for other critical projects to help mitigate flooding, restore our coastline, and protect our incredible Sportsman’s Paradise. In fact, there will be more investment and more coastal restoration and protection projects underway in 2019 than ever before."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Remember: we did all this in spite of simultaneously resolving the largest budget deficit in the history of the state left by the previous administration.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,But we know there’s still much work to do.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I imagine many of you share my frustration that fixing the budget impeded our ability to pursue some of the other priorities. So much damage had been done, and we knew it would take years to recover – and in some ways we still are recovering. But now, we have the opportunity to begin making real, lasting change that will positively impact the people we have sworn to serve."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,This is our chance to continue moving Louisiana forward.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Now, I know we’re not used to hearing the word “surplus” around here very often, but I have checked with economists and it turns out surpluses are actually better than deficits."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Unlike in the past, today, we have the opportunity to put our names on a budget we can all be proud of. All we have to do is recognize the revenue right in front of us. And then we can get to work on making real progress for our state."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"For the last year, you have heard me say that giving our teachers a pay raise is my number one priority. This is well deserved and long overdue."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We are all here today in great part because a dedicated teacher believed in each of us. I was blessed to have many amazing teachers growing up. And I certainly wouldn’t be standing here today if not for my favorite teacher, who has been by my side for more than 30 years, my wife Donna."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Unfortunately, fewer young people are choosing to go into the teaching profession because they see the underfunded classrooms, lack of appreciation, and stand-still pay. We have teachers preparing our children for the future while struggling to provide for their own."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"They are frustrated, and they have every right to be."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Our teachers are so committed to the success of their students that most, 94 percent in fact, are paying out of their own pockets for school supplies."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I want to bring our teacher pay up to speed with other southern regional states starting with a $1,000 pay raise this year. This would be the first step in a multi-year process."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Because our teachers deserve more.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Teachers like Ms. Chantelle Roussel, who has been in the classroom for nearly 20 years. Chantelle recently returned to a school that is no stranger to her, Duplessis Primary in Ascension parish, to be a kindergarten teacher…or so she thought."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Chantelle was asked to fill a position in special education that had been vacant for a month. It’s a story we hear much too often these days – teachers having to fill multiple roles due to shortages. Teachers having to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. But Chantelle stepped up when her school and those students needed her, and now it’s time for us to step up for her and for all teachers in this state."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"It is also important that we value the efforts of each person working in the school building, from those feeding students in the cafeteria to those ensuring that our classrooms are sanitary. As such, I also support a $500 raise for school support personnel."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,The people who work in our school buildings are just as dedicated as the teachers in our classrooms. A perfect example of that is Patrick Landreth who is a custodian at Mooretown Elementary School in Shreveport. Patrick arrives to work at 4 a.m. every morning. He mows the lawn early so that students won’t be distracted by the noise. He keeps the classrooms spotless so that students have a welcoming place they want to come back to every day.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Simply put, he makes educating students possible, and he does so with enthusiasm and with a smile on his face."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Ms. Cathy Braden also works at Mooretown as a paraprofessional while also working to attain her teaching certificate. Her supervisors say that she goes above and beyond to make lesson plans better and brings a wealth of knowledge from her background of teaching early childhood special education. She is an Army veteran, a grandmother, and a caregiver for her mother."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I am proud to say that Chantelle, Patrick, and Cathy are all here with us today. So if you will please stand to be recognized."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Thank you for your dedication to our students.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Make no mistake – the pay goes to the adults, but the investment is in our children."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"As with teacher salaries, the state’s per-pupil allocation has been neglected for too long. In addition to giving our teachers a pay raise, I am seeking to invest more in the classroom, an increase of 1.375% in the MFP, which would be the second MFP increase in the last ten years."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"It goes hand-in-hand with the teacher pay raise, and that’s why we included this in our budget proposal."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,I am also committed to ensuring all high school students have access to dual enrollment opportunities at our colleges.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Students who participate in dual enrollment are more likely to meet college readiness benchmarks and boast higher college completion rates. It’s a chance for students to get real college experience before they get there. And it could even be a chance for Louisiana colleges to have an edge on keeping high-performing students in state after they finish high school.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Dual enrollment is a leg up that should be afforded to any student who qualifies.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Sadly, this is not currently the case."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"That is why I support legislation designed to create a statewide framework to ensure all eligible Juniors and Seniors across the state of Louisiana have access to dual enrollment, no matter their zip code and no matter their ability to pay."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We have a long road ahead before we reach true educational equity, but there are smart investments in education we can make today that will accelerate student success. Dual enrollment is one of them."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Our teachers aren’t the only ones suffering from inadequate pay.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Every year, I stand here and make the case for why we should increase our minimum wage and pass equal pay legislation. And every year that goes by without action, we are falling further and further behind. I challenge everyone in this room to look at your family’s finances and try to imagine making it on $7.25 an hour. For thousands of Louisianans, that is their reality."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"While we refuse to act, our neighbors in Arkansas have raised their minimum wage three times, most recently with an $11 an hour ballot initiative that passed with 68 percent of the vote."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,I believe it’s time to look outside the walls of this building and let the people of Louisiana decide if raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Therefore, I support a constitutional amendment to provide for a state minimum wage of $9 per hour effective July 1, 2020. For three years now, I have asked you to support an increase in the minimum wage in this state, and yet, many workers in Louisiana are still no closer to a wage that can support a family or bring them out of poverty."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"So I ask you today, even if you have in the past not supported a minimum wage for our workers, give the people of this state a right to decide. I ask you to support this constitutional amendment to let the people of our great state use their voices - and their votes - to determine if we should join the other 44 states that have enacted a minimum wage."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Additionally, Louisiana continues to have the highest gender wage gap in the country. The gap exists in all fields, regardless of profession or educational background, and jobs predominantly filled by women are paid less than jobs mostly filled by men."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"As I’ve said before, there’s no point in talking about family values if we aren’t actively valuing families."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I am advancing legislation to eliminate pay secrecy by prohibiting employers from taking action against employees for inquiring about, discussing or disclosing their wages or another employee’s wages."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,Do you really believe someone should be able to be fired for discussing their salary?
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"This is the right thing to do, and we know it will help close our wage gap."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,The health of our people should also be a priority this session.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Medicaid expansion was a huge leap forward in improving health outcomes, but it is far from the finish line."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,I am committed to ensuring that every applicant for health insurance in Louisiana is not denied access to coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We all know the Affordable Care Act is flawed, but we should not have to fight to protect a provision that is overwhelmingly supported by most people in this state and throughout the country."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"This is personal for me. I know what it’s like being a young, first time parent hearing the doctor tell you that your child will likely face life-long medical challenges. And I know many parents like us would also spend their last penny to see their child get care."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,But it shouldn’t have to be that way.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"There are 850,000 other Louisianans who have found themselves in a similar situation."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"When you look at the list of conditions that qualify as “pre-existing,” either you or someone you know has been personally impacted."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I hope as we move forward through this session that there is a very robust discussion about how we can continue to protect those, like my daughter and like so many other family and friends, with pre-existing conditions, and why that coverage is now at risk."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I do not want the nearly one million Louisianans living with pre-existing conditions to get caught in the middle of Washington-style politics. They deserve better than that. Therefore, let’s all work together to find out what really works to maintain coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, while ensuring that insurance costs do not go up."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"In 2017, we scored a major victory in the fight against the opioid epidemic by enacting a seven-day prescription limit for opioids, and this year, I propose that we continue to chart a new course in addressing opioid-related harms."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I support legislation to enhance data reporting of fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses where opioids are suspected or present. This will create a mechanism for rapid surveillance of overdoses in the state, which will help better inform us on how to prevent, intervene in and treat opioid addiction. It will allow us to continue to find better ways to fight this problem, which is ripping so many of our families apart."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We are also taking aggressive measures to address Louisiana’s deteriorating rural water infrastructure. Water is something we so often take for granted, and yet it is as essential to life as breathing."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Over half of the water systems in Louisiana are more than 50 years old. The situation is especially critical in rural areas. When water systems fail, emergency actions on the part of the state are required."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"When I took office in 2016, the water coming out of faucets in St. Joseph looked like this."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Now, it looks like this. But the town of St. Joseph is not alone in facing challenges with its water system."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Last year, I launched a working group to address the water infrastructure needs of rural communities across the state. Our goal is to bring existing resources together in a coordinated and collaborative effort."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Already, we have secured $10.8 million in Delta Regional Authority investments, which were leveraged with other public and private dollars to bring in a total of $131 million for projects in the 56 distressed DRA parishes."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"By creating a permanent body, we will be able take a more long-term, robust approach to address these immediate needs."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Last, but certainly not least, let’s do more to support Louisiana veterans."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Already, we have expanded the Military Family Assistance Fund, established a Women Veterans Outreach Program, and announced the opening of 30 new veterans centers on higher education campuses across the state. In fact, the veterans center at LSU in Baton Rouge was named best in the nation last year."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"We know that our veterans don’t stop serving when they come home. They continue to play an integral part in our communities and in our economy. Therefore, I support legislation establishing the Veterans First Business Initiative. This statewide initiative is designed to identify veteran owned businesses in Louisiana, create a veteran owned business designation that they can use, and develop a website for Louisianans to search for various goods or services from veteran owned businesses."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"For example, one of the veteran-owned business that would be featured on this website is a Baton Rouge restaurant called BRQ. The co-owner, Justin Ferguson, is an Army veteran who completed two tours in Iraq. Justin makes it a priority to hire other veterans who, like him, face the struggles of returning to civilian life."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Justin is here with us today – Justin, will you please stand?"
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Thank you for your service to our country. And I want to thank you for supporting other veterans with jobs and training. You represent the best of the spirit of the military, of working hard and of never leaving anyone behind."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"And, folks, I’ve had his food before and he doesn’t just know how to lead and inspire, he can cook too."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Here’s what I think is so important to remember, we have made tremendous progress in the last three and a half years, not because of one person or one party, but because many people from different parties have come together to make it happen."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,We live in a time where it seems like people are becoming ever more divided. We work to one up each other instead of fighting together for a better Louisiana.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,But let me tell you. I’ve learned a lot in my time traveling the state.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,I’ve been fishing off the coast with our fishermen. I’ve been to National Guard ceremonies to honor our soldiers and airmen as they are deployed all over the world. I’ve enjoyed a pea cookout with farmers in Bastrop while listening to their concerns about the future of agriculture. I’ve prayed with families who lost everything in the floods. I’ve celebrated with new graduates and their proud families from Northwestern State to Delgado and from Grambling to SOWELA.
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"And no matter where I go across this state, I am more and more convinced that there is far more that unites us than divides us."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"Today, I am standing here before you in a room full of people who care about this great state and her amazing people. That breeze of hope I spoke of in 2016 is still blowing. It has gotten us this far, and it can carry us into the future we all want for our children and grandchildren."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,"I am standing here in a room of Louisianans. I am proud to stand with you. And, together we can continue moving Louisiana in the right direction."
Louisiana,John Bel Edwards,Democrat,God bless you and God bless the great state of Louisiana.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Mr. President; Madam Speaker; Chief Justice Saufley; Chiefs Francis, Nicholas, Sabattis, and Paul; Ambassador Dana;"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Secretary of State Dunlap; Treasurer Beck; Attorney General Frey; Auditor Buckley;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Honorable Members of the 129th Legislature;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Three months have passed since the general election.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Two months since the Legislature was sworn in.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Nearly all our cabinet members are confirmed, sworn and qualified. They are here tonight."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We are getting to work.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,I want to take a moment to thank the people of Maine for the outpouring of warmth you have shown me in the last month.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"I have felt in my heart the very best of Maine from all over Maine – the energy, the strength, the hope of Maine people."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Today we dig out from tunnels of snow, finding the light of our days to be longer, our dark nights shorter, and we sense that nature and the world are moving toward spring."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"We care for our neighbors, old and new, frail or strong."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"We care about those who need the most, those who work the hardest and those who pay the most."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Today we take account of the past and plan for a new, and better future."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Our unemployment rate is low. But our economy has grown more slowly than that of the United States and New England since 2010.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Our poverty rate is below the national average. Still 1/6th of our children live in poverty.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Our per capita income is growing; but it is still the lowest in New England, as is our average household income."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine’s public high schools rank fifth in the country. But the percentage of our adult population with postsecondary degrees is well below the New England average.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The quality of our health care ranks 10th in the country. Yet the public health of our citizens is ranked 33rd in the country.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine has many assets.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,But it also has many challenges.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We cannot afford to stand still.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget moves us forward.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The budget is about Health. It is about Opportunity. It is about Prosperity. It is about Education.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"It is, in sum, about HOPE."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Health care is a major focus of this budget, and it is a vital part of moving our economy forward."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"You may have heard that more than 4,000 people are newly enrolled in MaineCare since January – people from all across the state."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"We intend that expanded MaineCare will help up to 70,000 people who now lack affordable health insurance, so that they can obtain preventive care, they can obtain early treatment for disease, they can remain in the workforce, and they will never again have to face the choice between medical care and bankruptcy."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,These individuals are not the only ones who will be helped.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Expanding MaineCare and enabling people to have health insurance will also help our rural hospitals – which are some of the largest employers in their communities, often the only source of care, and often on the edge of financial collapse – because expansion will reduce the amount of uncompensated care they are asked to provide."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"In turn, this will lower the inflation pressures on private health insurance policies."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"We expect that this in turn will reduce the cost of health insurance to small businesses, self-employed individuals and employees – whose insurance rates are essentially making up the difference for hospitals’ uncompensated care."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,But that is not enough. We will work with the Bureau of Insurance and the small business community to find additional ways to lower the cost of health insurance for small business.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Finally, MaineCare expansion will help Maine’s economy."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It will bring $500 million in federal funds to Maine. That is like getting a new contract for a ship at Bath Iron Works every year – except that the jobs will be statewide.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This influx of funds is projected to create 6,000 additional jobs from Sanford to Calais to Fort Kent."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"All of these workers will pay income and sales tax, which will in turn help the state’s bottom line."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This is economic development on a large scale.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"To support MaineCare expansion, we include $147 million in the state budget over the next two years – a figure arrived at based on the independent, nonpartisan analysis of the Manatt report."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We are also budgeting for a Medicaid Reserve Account of $29 million to cover any contingencies.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,These budget items are funded by normal income and sales tax revenues as predicted by the independent Revenue Forecasting Committee.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,That means no new taxes or fees.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,That $147 million will trigger around a billion additional federal dollars for Maine.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It is the bargain of a century.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"As good stewards, we will continuously review and manage the MaineCare program and evaluate the effects of expansion on:"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Health outcomes for our citizens,"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Hospital finances,"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Private health insurance rates, and"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Job creation.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget also addresses other public health challenges facing our state.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Among the most critical of these challenges is the opioid epidemic.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This week Attorney General Frey released statistics showing 282 drug overdose deaths for the first nine months of last year. That is one overdose death per day.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,But the numbers do not tell the whole story.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,One of those individuals was 21-year old Sean M. Yankowsky of Bangor.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"He died ten months after his brother, his only sibling and his best friend, 25-year old Adam Yankowsky, died from ingesting heroin laced with fentanyl."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Adam had overdosed before.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"He had been revived, Narcaned twice on one occasion, and sent home without any guidance about what he could do next or where he could get help."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Adam’s and Sean’s father, Maine State Police Detective David Yankowsky, and their mother, Shelly Yankowsky of Glenburn, join us this evening."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,They now work with the Bangor Area Recovery Network to help others battle the illness that claimed their two children.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"I want to thank them for their courage — the courage to carry on, the courage to speak up, the courage to help so many others. They are saving lives."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Oxford County Sheriff’s Deputy Matt Baker also joins us.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Matt is a 30-year veteran of law enforcement.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"He has told hushed audiences of how he tried to revive his own 23-year old daughter, Ronni, after she overdosed on heroin."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Coming home at 2:30 a.m. after working the late shift one night in 2015, Deputy Baker found his daughter in the bathroom, slumped over the toilet, not moving."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Her face was blue and she was unresponsive.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"""I felt her heart beat once and I started CPR,"" Baker said. ""Basically, my daughter died when I was doing CPR on her."""
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"""About three hours later,” he said, “I watched them wheel my daughter out on a gurney. This was the daughter who used to sit on my lap and talk about fishing with me. Now she sits on my mantle.”"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Today he is sharing this terrible experience in the hope that others will listen and learn, as he brings up the little girl Ronni left behind."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Matt, we are listening."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Also here tonight are Robert Fickett and Sharon Fields from Bangor. Both of them are in recovery. Bob coordinates the Recovery Coaches and Sharon coordinates the volunteers for the Bangor Area Recovery Network or BARN.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"They are success stories. They are giving back to their community. They are helping others and saving lives. Thank you, Bob and Sharon."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"For David and Shelley, Matt, Bob and Sharon, and so many families like theirs around the state – help is on the way."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"In addition to making more services available through MaineCare, and with federal monies currently available and with $5.5 million in non-tax dollars in this budget, we will provide:"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Training of recovery coaches for our emergency rooms;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Treatment based on a regional “hub and spokes” model,"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Purchase and distribution of Narcan at every appropriate venue,"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Medication Assisted Treatment,"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Resources for friends and families of persons with substance use disorder, and"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Robust prevention and education efforts to stem the tide of this epidemic.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"I am pleased with the progress to date on these initiatives under the leadership of our Director of Opioid Response, Gordon Smith. Thank you, Gordon."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,These initiatives supplement the vigorous efforts of law enforcement at all levels to stem the tide of drug trafficking into Maine.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We propose other public health measures:
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,expanding access to low cost drugs for the elderly and disabled –This is only the first step of many we will take to help our seniors in the coming years;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,investing $10 million from the Fund for Healthy Maine for tobacco and nicotine prevention measures. It is critical to address the dramatic increase in vaping and other nicotine use among our young people.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"filling the vacancies in our public health nursing corps, as the Legislature already directed us to do;"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,filling the longstanding critical vacancies in the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – an agency that has seen a 25 percent reduction in staff in recent years;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"And for our veterans, we fully fund the Bureau of Veterans Services outreach program to prevent homelessness and hunger among those who served our country with distinction. To those heroes I say, we will never forget you."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"In these ways and many others, we are rebuilding our public health infrastructure."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We are also rebuilding our education infrastructure.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The Department of Education has suffered from years of neglect.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"As of last December, it took up to six months for the understaffed Department to simply certify new teachers who were waiting to start work or to recertify those already working."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,That is unacceptable.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,With staffing adjustments this past month we have already reduced that wait time to less than six weeks.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,And we will not stop there.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"The Maine Department of Education will once again be a place that leads, inspires and fully supports our schools, teachers, and students."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget begins making pre-kindergarten programs available to every 4-year old in Maine.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This is a voluntary, four-year program, the initial phases are included in this budget."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We also provide $18.5 million to Child Development Services to support the needs of our youngest and neediest children.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"For kindergarten through high school, we provide an additional $126 million over the biennium."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This brings the state’s share of public education funding to nearly 51 percent of Essential Programs and Services (EPS).
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"When you include the state’s payments toward the teacher pension fund, the state’s share of K-12 education is 55 percent."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget invests in recruitment and retention to ensure that teachers in Maine will not be forced to leave the state for a living wage.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It is time to treat our teachers with the respect and dignity they deserve.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This budget ensures that no teacher in Maine will make less than $40,000 a year."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Tonight, we are delighted that Maine’s 2019 teacher of the year could join us – Joseph Hennessey from Piscataquis Community High School in Guilford."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Joe teaches English and has created imaginative curricula, literature-based, active reading, analytical writing, and public speaking."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Thank you for your service, Joe."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The budget also increases funding for adult education and career technical high schools so that every Mainer can compete for skilled jobs in an ever-changing economy.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Tonight, we also welcome the 2018 Career Technical Education teacher-of-the-year in the gallery – Russell Clark from the Sanford Regional Technical Center."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Russ teaches engineering and architectural design and exposes his students to the exciting things you can do with computer-aided-design (CAD) tools, 3D printers, and a laser cutter and engraver."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Thank you, Russ, for inspiring Maine’s next generation of architects and engineers."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine will not succeed if our graduates are burdened by debt and if adults cannot access continuing education.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"The budget therefore increases funding for the University of Maine System, for the Community Colleges, and for the Maine Maritime Academy."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,And it provides $3 million more for scholarships through the Maine State Grant Program to prevent students from going into debt.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Our investments in K-12 education are intended to help local schools and to help local property taxpayers.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,But we propose to do more for taxpayers.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The budget increases revenue sharing each year of the biennium.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It also increases reimbursements to municipalities for the homestead tax relief program and for disaster assistance.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It provides more money for county jails.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Taken together – more local school aid, more revenue sharing, more homestead reimbursements, more disaster assistance, more money for the jails – the net result is relief for property taxpayers."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We are also investing in infrastructure.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Over the next two years, we will pave about 2,000 miles of roadway, fix or replace about 135 bridges, and invest in rail, public transit, and seaports."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This will be supported by about $531 million of dedicated state Highway Fund revenue, leveraged federal revenues, and $200 million of state bonds."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"To expand the economy, the budget:"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Invests $2 million in broadband, designed to draw down much larger amounts of federal money to Maine;"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Funds $5 million for rural development; and
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Directs funding to market all parts of Maine not just as a tourist destination, but as places to live and work and raise a family."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Our Department of Economic and Community Development looks forward to leading in the creation of a long range economic plan for our state.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,The world is changing. We need to define Maine’s place in the new world.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We will work with the private sector and with groups like the Maine Development Foundation to identify our state’s many assets and build upon them to foster and attract:
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Sustainable farming, diversified fisheries and innovative forest products businesses"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Clean energy producers
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,High tech industries
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Data centers
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Places for people to work remotely, and"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,A quality of life that will attract young working families back to our state.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"The budget also allows for bonding for such things as broadband and Land for Maine’s Future, and other appropriate investments, and we look forward to working with the Legislature on a bond package that fully meets the state’s needs."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Climate change is a priority issue. Our Office of Policy Innovation and the Future is preparing a climate agenda which I will announce in the coming weeks.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Suffice it to say, we will make every effort, without additional general fund dollars:"
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,to assist the University of Maine in the research and development of offshore wind power;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,to provide incentives for community and residential solar power;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,to promote energy efficiency and weatherization;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,to increase the use of heat pumps;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,to build charging stations and incentives for electric vehicles;
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,and to help local and state government become “green.”
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Right now, Hannah Pingree, who leads the Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, is working with Efficiency Maine to develop a program to promote the installation of 100,000 heat pumps in businesses and houses by 2025."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"That alone would save $30 to $60 million annually in heating bills, and lower carbon emissions by 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons a year and wean our state off fossil fuels. We look forward to unveiling the details of this effort shortly."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Our budget bolsters public safety:
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,By beefing up security in courtrooms to ensure the safety of those seeking access to justice.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"By authorizing fifteen additional state troopers and sergeants to ensure a 24-hour police presence statewide, including in all rural areas."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"By adding seven positions to the Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit. There can be no more important purpose of government than to protect our children from violent predators, whoever they are, wherever they are, whatever their evil techniques."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,By adding a new position in the Attorney General’s Office to train investigators to detect and pursue those who prey upon our seniors and steal their hard-earned savings.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,And we fulfill our promise to the good people of Washington County to fund a correctional facility there.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,We will continue to work with community groups to combat the scourge of domestic violence.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"We will no longer reject valuable federal resources for vital services — including funds for substance use disorder treatment, life-saving cancer screenings and Alzheimer’s treatment, nutrition assistance for hungry families, children’s health insurance, the forest legacy program, and transportation funding."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"By some estimates, Maine has turned down almost $2 billion in federal money in recent years. This is money that Maine people have paid in federal taxes that is not being returned to them, but is going to other states instead."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,My Administration will work with the Congressional delegation to identify every source of benefits to which the Maine people are entitled and make sure our people get their fair share.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,So this is our budget.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"There will be those who say this budget is government spending run amuck, and there will be those who say we ought to spend more and more. I respectfully disagree."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Here is what I heard on the campaign trail last year.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine people want better health care.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine people want better schools.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine people want better jobs and greater economic opportunity.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Maine people do not want higher taxes.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This is a pragmatic, common-sense budget that lives within our means and delivers what Maine people want."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It is based on the projections of independent experts on the Revenue Forecasting Committee of the previous administration who also say that revenue beyond this biennium is expected to be $8.3 billion.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"That is hundreds of millions of dollars more than what this budget proposes. When taken in combination with the robust Rainy Day fund that we have protected, Maine is well-positioned in the years to come."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"In short, this budget is sustainable."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This budget is balanced, as the Constitution requires; it makes responsible investments to tackle serious challenges facing our state; and it honors the will of the people."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"For you, the members of the 129th Maine Legislature, I welcome your thoughts, concerns, and suggestions in the coming months."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Having sat in these chairs, I know that you will bring the concerns of your constituents to bear on this budget, and I look forward to that productive discussion."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,But keep in mind:
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,In this budget there are no tax increases.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,In this budget there are no gimmicks.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,In this budget there are no negative balances.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget is pro-growth. It is pro-jobs. It is pro-people.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget is for the small business struggling with health care costs and for employers seeking a skilled workforce.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget is for the parents who have lost their children to overdose and who are now raising their grandchildren.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This budget is for the families, children and seniors living without basic health care."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget is for state workers who need the resources to get things done for Maine people.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This budget is for the teachers who are paying for school supplies and food for their students out of their own pockets, while earning salaries that are not commensurate to the value of their work."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,This budget is for Maine’s towns and for the property taxpayers who have had to pick up the tab for things state government should have been paying for.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"This budget is about health, opportunity, prosperity, and education."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It is about HOPE.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,It is about help for those who have been left behind.
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"For teachers like you, Russ and Joe, it is about help for your schools, your students and your colleagues across the state."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"And for you, Shelly and David, for Matt, Bob and Sharon, and for thousands of other families, loved ones and unsung survivors, there is HOPE. I promise you. There is hope."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,"Finally, thank you to all the people of Maine whom I love with all my heart."
Maine,Janet Mills,Democrat,Thank you.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"As we come together once again for this time-honored tradition, it is my distinct privilege to be the first Maryland governor to begin a State of the State address by saying: Madam Speaker."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Mr. President, members of the General Assembly, and distinguished guests:"
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"It speaks to the greatness and diversity of our state and to the progress that we have made together that a young lawyer from Baltimore City, an African American leader from Baltimore County, and a Republican businessman from Prince George’s are all here before this General Assembly, having been chosen to lead our great state at the dawn of this new decade."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And this is possible because of those who came before us—selfless leaders like George Washington, who resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Forces just a few steps down the hall in our Old Senate Chamber; Francis Scott Key, who, when the future of a fledgling nation was in doubt, penned the words that continue to inspire us today; and trailblazers like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, statues of whom we will be dedicating next week in our Old House Chamber—leaders who displayed such courage and sacrifice in the name of freedom."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We have been fortunate to follow the example of influential leaders in our lifetime, too. Last year, we lost Speaker Mike Busch, who dedicated the greater part of his life in service to our state, and who left Maryland a better place than he found it."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And Thomas V. “Mike” Miller, Jr., who, after serving as Senate President longer than anyone in American history is now beginning his fiftieth year of public service as Senate President Emeritus. During his recent battles, Mike Miller has shown us all the true meaning of courage and determination."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"As we gather here once again in this historic place to take the first steps of this new decade, we do so with optimism and confidence in our collective ability to continue changing Maryland for the better."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Sadly, the country that we all love is increasingly divided by toxic politics. But here in Maryland, we have spent these past five years working together to tackle our common problems by accepting our shared responsibility to solve them."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Five years ago, during my first Inaugural Address, I said that the politics that have divided our nation need not divide our state, and I asked all Marylanders to seek that middle ground where we could all stand together. And while Washington seems to be more bitterly divided than ever, here in Maryland we have faced our challenges with civility and moderation. We have continued to put the people’s priorities ahead of partisan politics, and we worked together to achieve real, bipartisan, common sense solutions that worked for the people we serve."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"As a result, I am pleased to report that the state of our state has never been stronger."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"The people of Maryland, regardless of their party affiliation, are overwhelmingly pleased with the job that we have been doing."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,Maryland has indeed been setting a shining example for the rest of America.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And as we embrace the promise of this new decade, we have a renewed opportunity to meet the challenges that lie ahead by continuing on that path and by being accountable to the people who sent us here."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Five years ago, I pledged to put more people to work to grow the private sector and to turn Maryland’s economy around. And we have done exactly what we said we would do."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,More businesses are now open and more people are working than ever before in the history of our state. We ushered in the largest decline in unemployment ever recorded and had one of the greatest economic turnarounds in America.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,But there is one part of our economy that I can’t fix without your help.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Nearly every day, I hear from folks who say, “I love the State of Maryland. I’ve spent my whole life here, and I don’t want to leave my kids and grandkids, but I just can’t afford to stay here on a fixed income.”"
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We are losing many of our best citizens. People who have contributed so much and who still have more to offer are moving to other states for one reason: our state’s sky-high retirement taxes. They tell me that Maryland’s retirement taxes are simply too high, and that they are moving to Delaware, Florida, the Carolinas, or any other state where they don’t take so much out of their retirement checks."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"So we proposed the “Retirement Tax Reduction Act of 2020,” which will provide more than $1 billion in tax relief over five years."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Under this plan, retirees making $50,000 or less, who are often forced to make tough choices every single day just to make ends meet, will pay no state income tax whatsoever. And all retirees earning less than $100,000 will see a tax reduction of no less than 50% and up to 100%."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"This is the largest tax reduction in Maryland in more than two decades. It will provide tax relief for more than 230,000 Marylanders and will help keep tens of thousands of Maryland retirees from fleeing our state."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We have some of the best and most highly funded schools in America, and we have provided record funding six years in a row, committing nearly $40 billion to K-12 education."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We enacted the Casino Lockbox Initiative, which will require the investment of an additional $4.4 billion more into our local school systems for critical things like increasing teacher salaries, Pre-K expansion, extended academic programming for at-risk students, and innovative career technology programs. And we invested $350 million more in our FY 2021 budget to fully fund the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission without raising taxes."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,More than 75% of our entire capital budget goes toward education. No governor in the history of this state has ever invested more in education.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And you can help us build on that historic investment by passing our “Building Opportunity Act of 2020,” that will provide a record $3.9 billion in funding, the largest investment ever in school construction, which will enable us to fulfill every single request from every single jurisdiction in the state for new school construction and for upgrades and repairs to aging schools."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"I stand here today ready and willing to continue working alongside you to ensure that every single child in our state has access to a great education, regardless of what neighborhood they happen to grow up in."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"But instead of continuing to simply debate how much more we should spend, let’s have productive discussions about how we can hold local school systems accountable for the billions of state tax dollars we are already investing, and let’s make sure those dollars are getting into the classrooms where they belong."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Our bipartisan efforts should have one simple goal, and that is achieving better results for Maryland’s children."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We have taken a balanced, all-inclusive approach to infrastructure, investing $14 billion in transit—the most ever—and beginning construction on the Purple Line, which is the largest P3 transit project in North America."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,We proposed and negotiated a regional solution to address WMATA’s half-billion-dollar-a-year shortfall in order to save the Metro system.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"After decades of discussion, we negotiated a deal to finally move forward with the Howard Street Tunnel, which will break a major East Coast rail transport bottleneck, allowing for double-stacked trains, which will dramatically increase production at the Port of Baltimore and create thousands of Maryland jobs."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,We have moved forward on nearly all of the highest priority transportation projects in every single jurisdiction all across our state. Over 800 projects totaling $9 billion in roads and bridges are currently under construction.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We advanced a transformative regional interstate traffic relief plan, which will finally begin to address the second-worst traffic congestion in America and solve what has been the number one problem in the region for decades, and as chairman of the nation’s governors, I’m leading a national initiative focused on rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We pushed for landmark legislation which cemented our position as a national and international leader in combating greenhouse gas emissions, and implemented clean air standards which are stronger than 48 other states and nearly twice as strong as the Paris Accord recommendations."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"When it comes to the Chesapeake Bay, we committed $6 billion—the most ever in history—to clean up the Bay. And as chairman of the six-state regional commission, the Chesapeake Executive Council, I stood up and led the fight to protect and restore federal funding for the Chesapeake Bay."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And we are pushing for action to hold the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the EPA accountable for the pollution coming down the Susquehanna River, over the Conowingo Dam, and into the Bay. Maryland has made historic progress in Bay restoration, but we cannot, and should not, have to do it alone. I intend to keep pushing our upstream neighbors and federal partners to ensure that they are doing their fair share to protect this national treasure."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"To ensure that public officials are worthy of the trust that the people have placed in them, we introduced the “Ethics and Accountability in Government Act,” to strengthen and toughen state ethics laws. This is an important effort to help restore the public’s trust and to bring further transparency and accountability to Annapolis. We cannot allow the unethical behavior of a few to tarnish the goodwill of the many in our state capital."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"While Maryland is leading the way and setting an example in so many ways, there is one area where we continue to be on the wrong side of history. Our state has the unfortunate distinction of having the most gerrymandered districts in America."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"For five years in a row, we have introduced nonpartisan redistricting reform, and yet year after year this body has refused to even debate the legislation. We serve in the nation’s oldest state house that once served as the first capitol of the United States after the Revolutionary War. American democracy literally began right here in this very place. And yet when it comes to free and fair elections, we are failing to live up to that proud legacy."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,This General Assembly should not continue to ignore the will of the overwhelming majority of our citizens.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"In this highly partisan time in America, you have a chance to do the right thing. To strike a win for democracy, fairness, and decency by finally, after five years, bringing the nonpartisan redistricting bill to the floor of this body for an up or down vote."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Every issue I have talked about here today, and all of the bills you will be considering over the next 61 days, are important and worthy of debate and discussion. But none of them are nearly as important as addressing the out-of-control violent crime, the shootings, and murders that are destroying Baltimore City."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"In October, a two-year-old boy was riding in the car with his family on a Saturday morning when he was shot in the stomach. Last month, a 73-year-old grandmother was shot and killed after being caught in gang crossfire near the apartment complex where she lived. Twelve people were recently shot, and five people were killed, in just one night. More than 1,000 people were shot on the streets of Baltimore City last year. 348 people were killed. Another 60 people have been shot, and 23 people killed, just in the 29 days since this legislative session began."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"One concerned Baltimore City resident recently said of the violence: “I don’t know if prayers help, but we need prayers.”"
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"I’m a big believer in the power of prayer. And yes, we do need prayers, but prayers are not enough. We are also going to need you to take action to get these shooters off our streets."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"If you do not consider any other legislation, and if you accomplish nothing else in the next 61 days, pass the “Violent Firearm Offenders Act of 2020,” which increases penalties for those who use guns to commit violent crimes, toughens penalties for those who possess stolen firearms and guns with obliterated serial numbers, and those who use, possess, or supply illegal guns to violent criminals."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And pass the “Witness Intimidation Prevention Act,” which toughens penalties for those who intimidate and threaten witnesses."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And the “Judicial Transparency Act,” because the public also has a right to know about the sentences judges are giving to the most violent offenders. We have been fighting to bring more transparency and accountability to the executive and legislative branches. There is no reason why the judicial branch can’t be held accountable as well."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"People are being shot every single day in Baltimore City. This is an urgent crisis, and we have an obligation to do something about it right now. There can be no more excuses and no more delays."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"The time has come for Baltimore City to finally take back its streets and communities, once and for all. And they simply cannot do it without decisive action from this General Assembly."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"I recently had the chance to visit UMAR Boxing in West Baltimore, where Maryland Hall of Fame boxer Marvin McDowell trains and mentors local kids. He is not just teaching them boxing skills and discipline—he’s also teaching them life skills and giving them hope. His motto is “No Hooks Before Books.” And I met just as many kids who were there studying as there were boxing."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Marvin is fighting every day to save young people and the city that he loves. Marvin said, “If everybody had the same attitude I had, of hope, then that would be a change.”"
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"We are honored to have Marvin McDowell here with us this afternoon. Thank you, Marvin, for making a difference."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And Marvin is absolutely right. If we could all start from a place of hope and optimism, and if we could all find the will and the determination to come together, to take on even the most daunting challenges, then we can bring about change in Baltimore City, and we will continue to change Maryland for the better."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, our nation appears hopelessly and bitterly divided. Just 30 miles down the road in Washington, both parties seem to be consumed with partisanship and dysfunction."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"But as I look back at all that we have been through and all the progress that we have made together here in Maryland over these last five years, my experiences do not burden me with dread—they fill me with hope. I believe that in spite of all that divides us in America today, there is far more that unites us."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And as America searches for healing and a path forward, let them look to us. Because from the very founding of our nation, Maryland has always been guided by our commitment to fairness and justice, and by a conviction that no problem faces us that hard work, honesty, and courage cannot solve if we work together."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"And so today, with confidence in the inherent wisdom and good judgment of the people of Maryland and the people of our nation, I ask you, my partners in this legislature on both sides of the aisle, to continue forward with me on this path."
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,Let us continue to deliver real results for the people who put their trust in us. Let us keep putting the people’s priorities before partisan interests.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,Let’s keep changing Maryland for the better and continue setting an example for the rest of the nation.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,Thank you.
Maryland,Larry Hogan,Republican,"May God bless the great State of Maryland, and the United States of America."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Mr. Speaker. Madam President. Members of the House and Senate. Fellow Constitutional Officers. Members of the Governor's Council. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Judiciary. Members of the Cabinet and my Administration. Sheriffs. District Attorneys. Mayors. Local Officials. Reverend Clergy. Distinguished Guests.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"To our Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, my partner in leading this administration. I want to take a moment to extend gratitude, on behalf of all of us here today for your commitment to this endeavor and the sacrifices your family has made."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Members of my family who are here this afternoon, my brothers, Jonathan and Sandy. Our Dad, the best and smartest guy we’ve ever known, thanks for being an incredible role model for us."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Our wonderful children, Charlie, AJ and Caroline. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And my wife Lauren, the first lady of the Commonwealth, the love of my life for the past 31 years."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,And to my Fellow Citizens.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Let me begin by thanking the people of the Commonwealth for giving the Lieutenant Governor and me four more years to serve them. We remember election night in 2014. It was so close, it ended the next day. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We had a lot to prove to the people of Massachusetts. About our vision for the Commonwealth. Our approach to governing. Our priorities. Our work ethic. And our capacity to get things done.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We said we’d work to build a state government that was as thrifty, hard-working and creative as the people of this great state.  And we’re grateful for your continued faith in us."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"To the lawmakers returning to this chamber, we say welcome back. And we look forward to building on the partnership we’ve established and the progress that we’ve made. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And a special welcome to those of you who are embarking on a new journey here on Beacon Hill. I’m quite sure you’ve heard about the good work that goes on here, as well as those areas in which we fall short. We all strive to build a Commonwealth of hope, opportunity and possibility.  "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,And we seek to do so in a way that ensures people are heard.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,My advice? Spend time outside of the State House. Listen to your constituents. Lead with your head and your heart. And make the best decisions you can for those you serve.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And in this era of snapchats, tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, putdowns and smack-downs, I’d ask you all to remember that good public policy is about perseverance and collaboration. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Many times, it is a story written frame by frame by many players who write it over time, relentlessly pursuing an objective."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Think about the Commonwealth’s leadership on national issues.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We have the highest rate of health care coverage in the nation. But the story was written across two decades, ten legislative sessions, five governors and four Presidents."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We have best in the nation gun laws, a story that was written across multiple legislative sessions and several Governors and was almost always bipartisan."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We have a K-12 education system that, despite its limitations, is the envy of the country. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,This story was written by a large cast of leaders and contributors across decades of deliberation and action.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"As we approach the third decade of the 21st century, we’re engaged in a number of difficult policy issues. Some will be with us long after our time on Beacon Hill is done."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But it’s incumbent on us to pursue these tasks with foresight, intelligence and commitment, so that we can rest assured that when our time is done, those who come after us will be able to build on the foundation we’ve established."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"As I look forward, I’m grateful that we’re taking on difficult policy issues from a position of strength."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Massachusetts no longer has a structural budget deficit. In fact, we ended last year with a major budget surplus. Deposited over $650 million into our Stabilization Fund. And anticipate making another major deposit to that Fund at the end of this fiscal year. And we did it without raising taxes."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"When we took office the annual growth rate in Medicaid spending was in the double digits, drastically reducing what funds were available to support other important programs. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Today, it’s growing at a rate that is more in line with the increase in overall state spending."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We added 4,000 seats to our superb vocational and technical schools. And we invested $50 million in capital grants to upgrade equipment and expand programs in high demand fields."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"With your help, the Department of Children and Families has made tremendous progress serving some of the Commonwealth’s most at risk children and families. Caseloads are at historic lows and virtually all of our social workers are licensed."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The Registry of Motor Vehicles implemented a new technology platform and the federal Real ID program at the same time. This was a big lift, and there were some bumps along the way. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But this past fall, the Registry served 90 % of its customers in under 30 minutes and virtually everyone else in less than an hour."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We enacted the BRAVE Act and broke ground on a $200 million rebuild of the Soldier’s Home in Chelsea, proving once again that no state is more committed to delivering for its veterans than Massachusetts."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We doubled the earned income tax credit for 450,000 low income working families, invested over $100 million in new funding into our early education system and reduced the use of hotels and motels to shelter homeless families by over 95%."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We also worked with the Legislature on two procurements that will lead to 50% of our electricity being generated by clean resources. And then delivered a bid process that came in far below the prices people anticipated.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Think about that! 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We delivered huge environmental benefits and lower energy prices. And now everybody wants to duplicate our process.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Our regulatory reform project reduced the complexity of state government across the board, allowing our small businesses to become more competitive in a dynamic economy. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And our ‘get stuff done’ approach with public private partnerships in economic development, advanced manufacturing, robotics and smart materials has created jobs and opportunity across the Commonwealth."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"As a result, our economy is booming."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We have more people working than at any time in state history. Over 200,000 jobs have been created since we took office. Our labor force participation rate is at an all-time high. And people are moving to Massachusetts because we offer good jobs and opportunity."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Thanks to the hard work of so many, the state of our Commonwealth is strong!"
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"By putting the public interest ahead of partisan politics, we’ve made our Commonwealth a better place to live for our residents. But there’s always much left to do."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Twenty-five years ago, Massachusetts wasn’t a national leader in public education. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Since then, we’ve achieved remarkable success by working together on a series of education reforms. As a result, Massachusetts students have scored number one on the National Assessment of Educational Progress exams in English and math for much of the past decade. And last year finished first on the Advanced Placement exams as well."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But when it comes to the difference in performance between urban and suburban school districts, we can and must do better."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,The Foundation Formula needs to be updated and we’ll propose updates when our budget is filed later this month. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,But progress isn’t just about money. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Education Commissioner Jeff Riley proved during his time as Receiver in Lawrence that significant progress can be made in improving school and student performance by changing the way our schools operate. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Before that, he transformed the Clarence Edwards Middle School in Boston from the lowest performing middle school in the city into one of the best."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"With that success in mind, our budget will also include opportunities for underperforming school districts to invest jointly with the Department of Education in proven best practices like acceleration academies, professional development, after school enrichment and leadership development programs."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We all have an opportunity to give our kids their best chance to succeed in a 21st century economy. It’s up to us to come together and seize this opportunity and lay the groundwork for their success.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,There’s also much to do in transportation.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,I’ll begin with a quick shout out to our Transportation Futures Commission. Predicting a future where there is so much possibility is difficult. They did great work and I want to highlight some of their recommendations.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"First, continue to invest in public transportation."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,This is an area in which the Commonwealth sat on its hands for far too many years and we’re all paying the price for it. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Over the course of the next five years, the T plans to spend over $8 billion on infrastructure, much of which will be invested in its core system. This is more than twice what has ever been spent in any 5-year period."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,This will be no small task. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"One of the reasons previous administrations didn’t invest in the core system is the complexity of upgrading and modernizing a system that operates 20 hours a day, seven days a week."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The constant tug between getting people where they need to go and disrupting that system to make it better is a big challenge. But it’s one that must be identified, scoped and overcome."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The T also needs to leverage its automated fare system once it’s in place in 2020. For the first time, that system will give the T real time data on how its riders use the system. That creates huge opportunities to improve service. To think differently about fares, routes and pricing. And to modernize operations to better serve customers."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Second, we must make the investments in public infrastructure that will enable the next generation of zero emission and autonomous vehicles to thrive here in the Commonwealth. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Getting this right will require unprecedented collaboration with local government and our New England neighbors, as well as innovative partnerships with the private sector."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Third, reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the transportation system.  "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,The work we’re poised to do with other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states should produce a cap and investment system for transportation that mirrors our successful model for energy.  
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,It will create the largest program of its kind in US history.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Finally, we need to more fully appreciate the relationship between where people live and where they work and how state and local government policies affect their ability to get from one to the other."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,I’ve spoken before about this housing crisis. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"For over 20 years, we’ve produced less than half the new units of housing that we produced like clockwork in the previous forty years. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"As a result, we have limited inventory. And the inventory we have gets priced out of sight, forcing people to live farther and farther away from where they work."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"I believe that our housing bill was a strong step in the right direction to deal with this. It respected the need for communities to plan for themselves, but created incentives to tie development more closely to overarching strategies concerning transportation and land use generally. In the end, it failed because it was too much for some and not enough for others."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We shouldn’t let the perfect become the enemy of the good.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Building a stronger, more equitable, more resilient and more successful Commonwealth rests on several pillars. But one of the most important ones is delivering a big increase in housing production. We need to get this done."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We have also made progress on criminal justice.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Three years ago we enacted legislation that prohibited sending women who’d been civilly committed due to an addiction to prison. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,And two years ago we brought the curtain down on 30 years of shame and reformed the operations of Bridgewater State Hospital.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Last year, we worked together on an ambitious, comprehensive criminal justice reform package. One that among other things, gives us more tools to help the men and women who’ll someday return to our communities get the training, life skills and support they need to succeed upon their release."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,But our work here is not done.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"In deciding whether or not it makes sense to hold a dangerousness hearing, current law requires a judge to ignore any previous criminal history and to focus only on the crime before the court. Moreover, the list of crimes for which a prosecutor is allowed to make that request is quite narrow."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Too often, dangerous career criminals are arrested only to be released as soon as they appear in court. This sort of revolving door serves to undermine people’s faith in law enforcement and the courts. And it’s a threat to public safety."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Nobody wants to see someone’s life ruined over a small-time lapse in judgment. The law we worked on together last year addresses many of those issues.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But, we still need a common sense approach that provides the system with the ability to schedule a dangerousness hearing when individuals with violent histories come before the court."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Yarmouth Police Sergeant Sean Gannon, Weymouth Police Sergeant Michael Chesna, Auburn Police Officer Ron Tarentino and State Trooper Thomas Clardy all gave their lives carrying out their sworn duty, protecting the people of this Commonwealth.    "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Here with us today are Yarmouth Police Chief Frank Frederickson, Weymouth Police Chief Richard Grimes, Auburn Police Chief Andrew Sluckis and Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police Colonel Kerry Gilpin."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"We owe it to them, to their brothers and sisters in law enforcement and to our citizens to ensure that we’re doing all we can to keep dangerous people off of our streets."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Massachusetts is also a national leader in health care. We’re one of the healthiest states in the nation. And we have the highest rate of health care coverage. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Our health care cluster is a wonder, economically and clinically. It’s constantly delivering solutions to some of the most urgent and challenging problems facing patients and their families."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,The flip side is the price we pay.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Small businesses in Massachusetts have among the highest health insurance costs in the country. The price for the same medical service can vary by as much as 300% depending on where it’s provided.  
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Our community hospitals continue to struggle. And, ironically, some of the Commonwealth’s rules make it tough to practice modern medicine."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Later this year, we will file legislation to address these issues. By expanding the use of telemedicine, rethinking some of our scope of practice guidelines and dealing with the parity issues that have negatively affected individuals and families dealing with mental health issues."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,On opioid addiction we’ve made great progress. But we didn’t get into this crisis overnight and we won’t get out of it overnight either. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The members of this Legislature have been true partners on this issue, enacting two major bills that build on our four pillars of reform: prevention, education, treatment and recovery."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Not all that long ago, families, providers and first responders had virtually no hope. Today, we’re one of a handful of states that can say that overdose deaths have dropped since 2017. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,There are interventions and policy changes that have worked and others that show promise. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,We also added initiatives like credentialed recovery coaches that will be coming online throughout 2019 and beyond.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,Dealing with opioid addiction is enormously difficult. Relapse is an inevitable part of the story. Helping people avoid becoming addicted in the first place remains a challenge.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And defusing the presence of fentanyl, which is now present in 90% of all drug overdose deaths, is an enormous challenge."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"On behalf of the people of this Commonwealth and especially the families and family members who deal with this addiction every single day, thank you for your support as the Commonwealth battles this deadly disease."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"On the afternoon of September 13th, a series of explosions rocked Greater Lawrence resulting in one of the biggest disasters in the history of the Merrimack Valley. Dozens of house fires broke out across the region and one young man tragically lost his life. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Fire and police teams from across Massachusetts and New Hampshire raced to and spread out across Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, putting out fires and directing and re-directing traffic. They worked closely with the Red Cross, local non-profits, state officials and the leadership of the three communities to get people safely out of their homes and if they had no place to go, into a shelter."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"For the next 90 days there was an army of operators, tradespeople, first responders, inspectors and state and local officials working throughout the three affected communities: to lay down 50 miles of new mainline pipe, replace thousands of service lines into houses, businesses and apartment buildings and repair or replace thousands of hot water heaters, stoves, dryers and boilers. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,It was an enormous and complex undertaking.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Throughout this ordeal, homeowners, families and businesses affected by this disaster showed a tremendous amount of patience, resilience, flexibility and fortitude. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,There were hundreds of local officials and elected leaders who went above and beyond the call on this one. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But I want to give special mention and thanks to several local officials that are here with us today, Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera, Fire Chief Brian Moriarty and Police Chief Roy Vasque. Andover Town Manager Andrew Flanagan, Fire Chief Michael Mansfield and Police Chief Patrick Keefe. And North Andover Town Manager Andrew Maylor, Fire Chief William McCarthy and Police Chief Charles Gray. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,These leaders really delivered and we’re honored to have them here with us today. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,It’s in moments like this that everyone remembers why committed and creative public service matters. 
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"At the same time, the day to day work often goes on without much notice. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,The fact that 351 cities and towns in this Commonwealth have worked with state government on over 800 best practices and now use that program to spread the word on other smarter ways to deliver services doesn’t make much news.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The work we’ve done together to invest billions of dollars in housing, downtown and regional economic development and public/private partnerships in communities across the Commonwealth are stories that come and go. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"The 16,000 trees we’ve planted and thousands of LED lights we’ve installed with our colleagues in local government is just doing our job."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Each day, the wheels turn, and when they turn well they build strong communities. Support great schools. Grow the economy. Clean up the environment. Promote justice. And give people a chance."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Those wheels create hope, opportunity and possibility ."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Sure, there’s noise. Tons of it. Most of the time that back and forth is positive. It’s people offering a point of view with heart and intelligence in a democracy designed to encourage it. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"But these days, too much of what pretends to be debate is just rhetoric or character assassination. And every time someone joins that chorus they steal time, attention and focus away from finding common ground, creating solutions and doing the work that matters."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Whether it’s the grind of the day to day, or a crisis, we all need to work together because that’s what great public service is all about."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"During the winter of 2015, I saw firsthand during the snowstorms how amazing this nation’s mutual aid programs between states can be. Other states bailed us out as the snow kept falling with no end in sight. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And during the first chaotic and terrifying 24 hours of the Merrimack Valley disaster, the number of first responders who just dropped whatever they were doing and headed there was amazing."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,That’s public service and people appreciate it.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Over the past four years, the Lieutenant Governor and I have heard time and time again that the way we all work together is a model for the nation.  "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,People like our collaborative approach to governing. And they say they’re proud to be from Massachusetts!
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,And so am I!
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"This state is bursting with talent, humor and decency. Boldness and common sense. Our abiding sense of patriotism, belonging and community has made us strong and has carried us forward for almost 400 years."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"Let others engage in cheap shots and low blows. Let’s make our brand of politics positive and optimistic, instead of cruel and dark."
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,"And instead of the bickering and name calling that dominates much of today’s public debate, let’s build on the work of those who came before us. "
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,And make our work about how we can make this great state better for the people who call this glorious place ‘home.’
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,God Bless This Commonwealth.
Massachusetts,Charlie Baker,Republican,God Bless the United States of America.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist; Speaker Chatfield; House Democratic Leader Greig; Senate Majority Leader Shirkey; Senate Democratic Leader Ananich; members of the cabinet; my daughters, Sherry and Sydney; my husband, Marc; and my fellow Michiganders: Good evening. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak tonight about the growing challenges we face in Michigan, the steps we are going to take to address them, and my priorities for the next year and beyond."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"As you can imagine, over the past few weeks, I’ve gotten a lot of unsolicited input about what I should say tonight, and what I should focus on as governor. Someone even suggested, after the recent record-breaking cold, that I should, quote, “fix the damn weather.”"
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I guess the cat’s out of the bag, now you know my campaign slogan for 2022."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Joking aside, I want to thank all of the dedicated public servants who showed up for work in dangerous conditions to keep the rest of us safe."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I also want to express my deepest gratitude to the Michiganders who keep us safe every day in the Armed Services, and all of the veterans who have risked their lives to serve the United States of America."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"One of those veterans — and one of Michigan’s greatest leaders — was Congressman John Dingell, who passed away last week at the age of 92.From his courageous service in World War II to his model leadership over 59 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Dingell devoted his life to serving the people of Michigan. He will forever be remembered as “The Dean” of Congress – not simply for the length of his service, but for his crucial role in passing some of the most monumental laws of the past century. He was the epitome of what I think we in Michigan know: YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE MEAN TO BE STRONG. And those who live by this creed can get things done."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,I extend my deepest and most heartfelt condolences to Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the entire Dingell family for their loss. We are a grateful nation and a proud state. I want to welcome the public servants who are either new to state government or who are in new roles.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Like Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Attorney General Dana Nessel, and all of the dedicated members of my cabinet – which by the way – is the most diverse cabinet in Michigan history."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And the new leader of our state’s highest court is also here tonight: Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack. Today, for the first time in Michigan history, our Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Chief Justice are all women. Not to overlook our U.S. Senator and a record FIVE members of our U.S. House delegation."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Finally, I want to congratulate the 52 members of the legislature who are embarking on their first term in office."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I remember the excitement I felt as a 29-year-old freshman lawmaker. I sat where you are as a House member, and eventually as a senator, and watched three governors give the State of the State address. Back then, it never dawned on me that I would deliver this speech one day. I am eager to work with you on behalf of the people we serve."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"We have to work together. Because, as I have said before: Michigan’s problems are not partisan problems. Potholes are not political. There is no such thing as Republican or Democratic school kids or drinking water. Our challenges affect us all. And they will require us all, working together, to solve."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Despite our challenges, Michigan’s greatest strength is — and always has been — our people. It’s no accident that Michiganders are a diverse, persevering, and innovative group. Just think about the people who built our state: Dutch immigrants who settled in West Michigan to work the land. Finns who came to mine in the UP."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"African Americans who came north for jobs in the auto industry. People from the Middle East who made Dearborn one of the country’s most vibrant, flourishing Arab-American communities. People from around the world came here for good-paying jobs, a high-quality education for their kids, and the right to live and worship freely."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"The diverse people who built our state saw Michigan not just as a potential home, but as a home for opportunity."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,Michigan’s Growing Challenges. That is our legacy. Michigan has been a home for opportunity for 182 years.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Of course, our predecessors overcame some big obstacles along the way. And now, it is our turn to ensure Michigan is a home for opportunity today and for future generations. There are some wonderful things happening in our state. There are also some serious challenges."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Today, Michigan is confronting two major crises. The first is our failing infrastructure. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave Michigan infrastructure an overall grade of D-plus. Our roads fared even worse—a D-minus—with just 18 percent of Michigan roads in “good” condition. Another recent study found that Michigan has the worst roads in the country. The worst."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Let’s be honest: we don’t need studies to tell us this. The evidence is impossible to ignore. Just a few weeks ago, I-75 was suddenly shut down in Oakland County because of dangerous potholes that flattened and destroyed tires sidelining dozens of cars. The potential consequences of course can be far more serious than a flat."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Right now, we have crumbling bridges with hundreds of temporary supports holding them up. Buses of school kids and families travel over them—and under them. Chunks of concrete have slammed through windshields. By one estimate, the vehicle damage from our roads costs the average motorist $562 a year in repairs. We’re paying a road tax that doesn’t even fix the damn roads. That’s money that could go toward childcare, rent, college tuition, or retirement savings."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And while it’s hard to imagine things getting worse, that is precisely what will happen if we don’t act boldly and swiftly. Because over the next decade, the share of Michigan highways and trunk lines in poor condition will more than double—worsening the severity of the danger and costing drivers across our state even more. It endangers our lives. And robs us of our time and our hard-earned money."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,It hurts our businesses’ bottom lines. It jeopardizes our edge in mobility. And limits our economic potential. Because no one will invest in a state that doesn’t invest in itself.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And let’s be clear: Incremental fund shifts, like we’ve seen in recent years—don’t fix the problem. They only slow our decline."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,And I didn’t run for governor to manage the decline of our state. I ran to make sure this state is one where our kids stay and families thrive.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Solving this crisis will not be easy. We didn’t get here overnight. This is a challenge 30 years in the making—the result of underinvestment across multiple administrations. We need to act now, before a catastrophe happens or the situation becomes truly unrecoverable. And we all have a role to play."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"So to everyone at home: Share your stories about what the infrastructure crisis means to your families. Take a picture of your damaged car or repair bill and post it with the hashtag #FTDR.I’m sure you know what that stands for by now. Michigan businesses: Quantify how it’s impacting your bottom lines and share it with us using #FTDR.And to the legislature: When you’re home in your districts, talk with local leaders and identify infrastructure priorities in the areas you represent."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And then, let’s come together and pass a budget that actually fixes the damn roads! Of course, you can’t navigate any road if you’re looking at your phone. So in addition to better roads, we need safer roads, too."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Car crashes are the number one killer of our young people. I recently met Steve Kiefer, who told me about his son Mitchel – a 2016 graduate of Detroit Catholic Central, and a member of the state championship hockey team. Mitchel was a freshman at MSU when he was tragically killed by a distracted driver on I-96. The family formed the Kiefer Foundation to carry on Mitchel’s legacy and end distracted driving – and they’re already making important progress. I’ve got to tell you, there is nothing more amazing to me than parents who channel the loss of their child into a cause that helps other people’s kids."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Today we are joined by Mitchel’s parents, (gesture) Steve Kiefer and Paula Kiefer, as well as Mitchel’s brother and sisters, Blake, Julianna and Alexa."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,I know the Kiefers and I believe it’s time for Michigan to join the 16 states that have passed hands-free laws to keep our roads and our kids safe. So let’s make it happen.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"We also face serious problems with our water infrastructure. Last month, Flint’s water showed the lowest levels of lead and copper contamination since the start of the crisis four years ago. That’s good, but our work is not done."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"We are home to 21% of the world’s fresh water and yet too many families in Flint and across our state don’t have access to clean drinking water. Contamination from old pipes is not the only aspect we must address. Over the past year, toxic chemicals known as PFAS have been found in our lakes, our rivers, and our water systems in more than 70 communities spanning both of our peninsulas. This problem may not have commanded the same kind of national attention as the situation in Flint. But it is just as urgent. It is time to step up our efforts to protect the health and safety of all Michiganders."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"From our roads to our water, infrastructure is the crisis we see — we see it in on our commutes, in our communities, and in our homes. The second crisis is harder to see, but we all know it exists: it’s the crisis in education and skills."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And, like infrastructure, it impacts every one of us — our employers, our workers, and all of our children. Today, third graders in Michigan rank in the bottom ten in the country in reading. The bottom ten. Since 2014, among states measured every year, Michigan has experienced the worst decline in childhood literacy. And the decline has been consistent across every racial and economic group in our state."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Let’s be clear: This is not happening because Michigan kids are less talented. It’s not happening because our kids are less motivated. It’s not happening because our educators are less dedicated. It is happening because generations of leadership have failed them. In the past 25 years, Michigan has seen the lowest growth in the K-12 education spending of any state in the nation. During that time, our per-pupil funding revenue has actually fallen by 15 percent. And in the last decade, as our literacy crisis has grown, our predecessors have repeatedly raided K-12 education funding to fill gaps elsewhere in the state budget."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Despite these challenges, we have incredible educators like Marla Williams – who is here tonight — Marla is a special ed teacher at Davison School in Detroit, where she is known as a tireless advocate for her students. In class, Marla ensures that her special ed students have all the same opportunities as their peers. But her work doesn’t stop when the bell rings at the end of the day. She goes to their birthday parties. She visits them when they're sick. She has even taken some of their laundry home and washed her students’ clothes herself. She changes lives for the better every day."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"That's because she – like so many Michigan educators – knows teaching is more than a career, it is a calling. I want to send a message to all of the devoted educators across Michigan: You’re not failing us. We have been failing you. Our educators deserve our support — not a funding crisis that undermines their work, weakens our schools and hurts our kids. We know that potential is universal, but right now opportunity is not. Our students are not broken. Our teachers are not broken. It’s our system that’s broken. We can’t fix it overnight. And greater investment alone won’t be enough. But we’re going to do it, because nearly two million kids are counting on us."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Our education crisis compromises our workforce — this at the moment when the skills we need to compete for good-paying jobs are rapidly changing. At the Detroit Auto Show last month, I met with auto executives who said their number one challenge was attracting enough talent. They used to need auto engineers. Today, they need software engineers and developers and skilled trades people, too. The skills gap poses a serious economic challenge for us. And part of the problem is we have failed to prioritize talent and ensure everyone has a path to skills. The vast majority of today’s jobs require some form of postsecondary education, whether it’s a degree or a skills certification."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"But, as of 2016, only 44 percent of our workforce has such a credential. Simply put, that’s not good enough for Michigan to compete. I don't accept it. None of us should. As I said, these challenges affect us all. They make Michigan a harder place to get ahead. A harder place to raise a family. A harder place to run a business. And they are even tougher to solve because pressures on our state government have been building up for years. Departments that are understaffed, that lack diversity, and suffer from low morale. Outdated technology and IT challenges that impede both state employees’ ability to do their jobs and Michigan residents’ ability to access government services. Severe budget constraints that prevent badly needed investments in our roads, infrastructure, and more. Over the past month, the LG and I have visited every department in person. I met state employees who have served the public for decades and never even met a governor."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I listened and learned about the obstacles they try to navigate on a daily basis to serve the people of our state. I promised I will do everything I can to support them. Because while many focus on what happens here at the capitol . . . the real work of state government — protecting the public, educating our kids, working with business — is done by the 48,000 people of our state workforce. And they don’t get the gratitude they deserve."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"People like Eric Oswald — who’s with us today. Eric was a Colonel in the Air Force when he retired in 2017, and he was “looking for a new challenge” when the Flint Water Crisis hit. So he stepped up again to serve his state — this time as the DEQ’s Director of the Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Division."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,Eric said he sees the same qualities in his fellow state employees that he saw in the military: hardworking public servants committed to the mission of protecting and serving others. They deserve our thanks and support. And I’m proud to be in their ranks.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"These challenges aren’t the fault of any one politician or party. I spent 14 years in the legislature, so I know how tough it is to keep the government funded and functioning. But I also know this: turning a blind eye or passing phony fixes won’t solve problems. In fact, they make it harder. Filling potholes instead of building roads. Pretending that little increases can fix an education crisis. Playing a shell game with the state budget. Ignoring the potential of hundreds of millions of dollars from lawsuits against the last administration. Giving sweetheart deals to political insiders. Spending $1.3 billion on the last day of the lame-duck session in December."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"A government that doesn’t work today can’t get the job done for tomorrow. And that ends now. As a state, we must make the bold choices so we can build a stronger Michigan. And we need to work together."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I recognize that the tone starts at the top. And that’s why I took a number of steps during my first month in office to make sure Government works. So our employees, our businesses and our people can trust us. My first act was an executive directive so state employees know how and are empowered to alert us of imminent threats to public health, safety, or welfare."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Valid concerns about public health and welfare will be acted upon. I also established stronger ethics rules for the executive branch, including a ban on the use of private email accounts to conduct state business. For too long, our government has been plagued by a lack of transparency. We have consistently ranked the worst in the country. We have the power to fix that: let’s expand FOIA to my office and to the legislature. It’s time to ensure that the sun shines equally on every branch of state government."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I also signed an executive directive banning state government from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity – without any exemptions. Now Michigan government is on the right side of history. Because nobody should ever be fired because of who they are or who they love. It’ll help build and attract a talented, top-notch workforce. That’s precisely why the business community has pushed to extend these rights to the private sector as well. If we want Michigan to be a home for opportunity . . . it should be opportunity for all, in all workplaces. We need to expand the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to include protections for our LGBT community."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And I also mean equal opportunity for women. Today, women in Michigan’s workforce make 78 cents for every dollar that men make for doing the same job. Women of color make even less. It is time for that to change. That is why I signed an executive directive prohibiting employers in state government from asking women applicants about their salary histories. This ensures past discrimination doesn’t hurt a woman’s future earnings. Those same protections extended to all Michigan women would cut the poverty rate among working women in half. Think about that. It would cut the poverty rate among working single moms by even more. Michigan women’s annual income would increase enough to pay for, on average, nearly 14 months of rent or more than 18 months of child care. That’s how we build a stronger economy. That’s making Michigan a home for opportunity for women."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,Opportunity: also means a level playing field for small businesses from Marquette to Macomb to Muskegon Heights. I’ve opened up contracting opportunities for small businesses in designated opportunity zones across our state. That means small businesses in geographically disadvantaged communities will have a level playing field. Let’s keep Michigan dollars in Michigan.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Let’s create more opportunities for companies like Open Systems Technologies in Grand Rapids, where I recently met president and CEO Meredith Bronk — who is with us tonight — and several women small business owners about leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs across our state."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"When we were in Grand Rapids we were joined by former Lieutenant Governor Brian Calley — or, as the newer legislators might know him, Rep. Julie Calley’s spouse. As the leader of the Small Business Association of Michigan, Brian has offered incredible support . . . It’s proof that, if we can put the election behind us, we have a great opportunity to work together and build a stronger economy."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"A strong economy also requires a concentration of talent. And, as I said earlier, we must ensure that every Michigander has opportunity through a path to skills that lead to a good job. Today’s jobs, and jobs on the horizon, demand greater education and training than ever before. Right now, Michigan is one of only 9 states in the country and the only state in the Midwest that hasn’t even established a formal goal for post-secondary attainment. That changes tonight."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"I am announcing a new statewide goal of increasing the number of Michiganders between the ages of 16 and 64 with a post-secondary credential to 60 percent by 2030. It’s aggressive. But great expectations lead to great results. To get there, we need to start thinking differently about what it takes to succeed. We used to think about careers in terms of ladders. One way up. But, today, it’s more like rock-climbing. There are many paths to a good life, and we need to help people find the one that works for them."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"That’s why, tonight, I’m announcing three paths for workers and students across our state. The first is for Michiganders who have already started their careers. As workplaces evolve, many people will need to acquire new skills to advance—or even just to keep the jobs they have now. There are also displaced workers across the state who are looking for new opportunities. That’s why we are launching: Michigan Reconnect. By training adults seeking an in-demand industry certification or associate degree, Reconnect is a path for working Michiganders to up-skill. It will also connect Michigan businesses to qualified candidates for the growing number of jobs that are currently unfilled."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"This initiative is modeled after a similar effort that Tennessee’s former Republican governor, Bill Haslam, launched last year. And it is already surpassing expectations."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"The second path is for graduating high school students who want to continue their education, but who decide that a four-year college or university isn’t for them. A four-year degree isn’t for everyone, but everyone needs skills to get a good job."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"For them: the MI Opportunity Scholarship, will guarantee two years of debt-free community college for all graduating high school students who qualify. The scholarship will be officially launched this spring and available to students in the fall of 2020. And it will make Michigan the first Midwestern state to guarantee community college for all. The third path is for graduating high school seniors who are . . .as my friends in the trades like to say, “just not skilled trades material.” I’m talking about a path for students who do want to pursue a four-year degree, but who can’t afford to do so."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"A study last year found the average cost of tuition, fees, and room and board at a public four-year school in Michigan is almost $22,000 a year. That’s the 10th highest in the country. And it’s a complete barrier for a lot of people in our state. That’s why the MI Opportunity Scholarship will provide two years of tuition assistance at a four-year, not-for-profit college or university for students who graduate from a Michigan high school with at least a B average. Real Paths. Real Opportunity."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Together, these paths will go a long way toward closing the skills gap, making Michigan’s economy more competitive, and creating real opportunity for everyone. If you’re willing to put in the work, you will have a path to succeed."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"But a strong Michigan requires more than a singular commitment to better skills. It also requires a commitment to the health of our workers, families, and communities. That is why we are taking several important steps to protect and improve public health. Last week, I announced the creation of a new agency that will bring sharper focus to addressing Michigan’s water safety and environmental challenges. The streamlined Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy will be tasked with ensuring that every Michigander has access to safe and clean drinking water. It will be charged with safeguarding our Great Lakes, and taking action to protect our state from the harmful effects of climate change."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,The agency will include the new offices of the Clean Water Public Advocate and the Environmental Justice Public Advocate. We’re going to make state government more efficient and more responsive to our environmental and public health challenges.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"The new department: “Eagle” has gotten bipartisan support from Michigan businesses and leaders, including Candice Miller — who’s with us tonight — as well as former Snyder administration DEQ Director Heidi Grether, and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. I also joined Michigan in the U.S. Climate Alliance, with a bipartisan coalition of governors from 20 other states that have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Two weeks ago we had wind chills: 50 below zero. Last week it was over 50 above. That’s a 100 degree swing – and a reminder that climate change and extreme weather are already putting Michiganders at risk. As a state, we must take that risk seriously. We cannot and will not wait to act."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Everyone in my administration is also committed to ensuring that all Michiganders have access to quality health care they can afford. During my time in the state Senate, I worked across the aisle with Governor Snyder, and Leader Shirkey and Leader Ananich, to expand Medicaid and provide coverage to 680,000 Michiganders through the Healthy Michigan plan. As governor, I am committed to defending Healthy Michigan, and we are already doing so in two important ways."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"First: Last week, I sent a letter to the Trump Administration about my concerns that new work requirements slated for next year may hurt Michiganders. I wrote that I intend to work with the legislature to find ways that both promote work and preserve coverage for people who need it."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Second: we have joined 19 other states to defend the Affordable Care Act in court. Hundreds of thousands of Michiganders’ health care is on the line, and I want to commend the Attorney General for leading on this vital issue. A Budget That Addresses Our Problems The policies that I have outlined tonight will strengthen the foundation for Michigan’s economic future. Next month, I will propose a budget for our state. My budget will offer a real solution to fixing our roads and rebuilding our infrastructure. It will give our frontline educators the tools they need to address our literacy crisis."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And most of all, it will reflect my unwavering commitment to making Michigan the home for opportunity. The people of Michigan voted for people they believed could solve problems."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"There are legislative districts in our state where I won by double digits, and voters also supported Republican legislators. Let’s prove to them – and the country – that divided government doesn’t have to mean gridlock. I am eager to engage with any and all people of good faith about ideas and priorities, including your ideas on bringing down car insurance rates. I am committed to this state and to solving problems, therefore, I will reject anything presented as a “solution” that doesn’t really solve a problem — or creates a new one. I will not sign anything that resembles the budget gimmicks and band-aids that have failed us in the past. I will veto bills designed to cut out the public’s right of referendum."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"And I will stay faithful to the mission of fixing the roads, improving skills through education and training, and cleaning up our water. And I’ll work with everyone who wants to do that. And one more thing: I pledge to continue the new culture that Governor Snyder created in Lansing over the last eight years: Budgets got done before the break. And that was a good thing. Because just like every other workplace, we shouldn’t go on vacation until we get the job done."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,I would love to see a show of hands from my friends in the legislature — how many of you agree with me? I hope the press is taking pictures of those hands. Let’s make it happen—and let’s do it together.
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Some will doubt our ability to find common ground; to make the bold choices needed to ensure Michigan will always be a home for opportunity. When you look at the dysfunction in Washington, that skepticism is understandable. Extreme partisanship, shut downs, and trade wars all put Michigan’s economy at risk. Those things are out of our control. Let us stay focused on what we can control. And let us strive to see the humanity in one another along the way. Because, when we do, it’s a lot easier to find common ground."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"You may know I am centered by my family and love for Michigan, the place I hope my kids will make their lives. Garlin Gilchrist is an engineer who moved back to Detroit with his wife Ellen to build a life for themselves, their twins Garlin and Emily, and a new member of the family due in June. Lee and Stephanie Chatfield are parents to five kids 8 and under. Four sons and a daughter. He, like I used to, lives next to his parents and he is guided by his faith."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"Jim and Andrea Ananich expanded their family through adoption a few years ago and they - like lots of Flint families - were worried about mixing baby Jake’s formula. Jim’s a teacher and has an affinity for giving nicknames. As dads of young kids . . . I bet they could get some pointers from the other two leaders: Mike Shirkey’s got 12 grandkids. He’s rarely spotted around town after hours because he likes to hightail it home to Jackson to have dinner with his wife, Sue. And Chris Greig, has three sons, loves tennis and when she gets home “Chef Bob” always has something amazing."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"We all have families. We all care about our kids’ and grandkids futures. We all want what’s best for our communities and our state. It’s important for us to remember that the enemy is not the person across the aisle. The enemy is apathy. The enemy is extreme partisanship. The enemy is self-interest. When we stand together as Michiganders — or Michiganians, for those of you who insist — we can get the job done for the people of our state. We can build bridges and ensure that Michigan is the home for opportunity for generations to come."
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"After my inauguration, I received messages of support and encouragement from people across our state. One of them was the granddaughter of Governor G. Mennen “Soapy” Williams. A former labor leader sent me a Soapy Williams-era bowtie with green and white polka dots, and his commemorative coin from the opening of the Mackinac Bridge. Holding that coin between my fingers was a moving experience — especially when I read the inscription on the back. It says: “Built by the will of a great people, upon foundations of Michigan's faith in her future.”"
Michigan,Gretchen Whitmer,Democrat,"More than 60 years later, we are still a great people. We still have the will. We still have faith. The question is: do we have the wisdom to put partisanship aside and get the job done for the people we serve? I think we do. So let’s get to work. Thank you."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Good Evening, Minnesotans."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Thank you for joining me on this beautiful Sunday.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,I am speaking to you live from the Governor’s Residence where I have been in self-quarantine.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Self-quarantine. Self-isolation. Social distancing.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Phrases that many of us never used before now roll off our tongue in daily conversation.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,A new vocabulary to define a new reality.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"A hard, cold reality. One that far exceeds the reality of Minnesota’s harshest winters."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"From my daily briefings, many of you know the current situation. You know about COVID-19 — and you know there’s a lot we don’t know about it. You know about the actions we’ve taken to combat it — and you know how these actions disrupt your daily life."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Many of you are out of work. Businesses, large and small, are shuttered across the state. The companionship we normally lean on to get through difficult times — a hug from a grandparent, coffee with a friend, or a laugh with a co-worker — forced out of reach."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Vacant streets. Deserted classrooms. Empty pews.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Chairs stacked on restaurant tables.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Graduations, weddings, and funerals postponed."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Right at the time Minnesotans are usually putting away their shovels and snowblowers, opening up their windows, and emerging from their homes — we are bracing for a storm of epic proportions."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"We are used to long winters in Minnesota. We are resilient people with a deep reserve of courage, optimism, and grit."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,But this will be a winter like we’ve never seen before.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"And as we have done for generations, once the tree limbs are stark and the sky a cold dark gray — we prepare."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"There’s no stopping the storm of COVID-19 from hitting Minnesota, but we are preparing for it."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We are building our hospital capacity so that we can ensure as many Minnesotans as possible receive the care they need when they need it.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We are increasing testing to better track the disease.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We are increasing ventilators and ICU beds for when people fall ill.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"And just as we wouldn’t send a loved one out into the cold without the protection they need, we are doing our best to find more personal protective equipment for the selfless doctors, nurses, first responders, and so many others on the front lines against COVID-19."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Minnesotans won’t just prepare for COVID-19 — we will lead.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The brilliant minds and hard work of Minnesotans will help lead the world’s response to this crisis.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Mayo Clinic is leading a national trial to use blood from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for others who fall ill with the disease.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Hospitals across the state, from the largest systems to the smallest, are preparing in new ways for a surge in patients."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,3M workers are producing millions of protective face masks a month.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Medtronic is publicly sharing the design specifications for its ventilators to spark rapid manufacturing of this critical equipment desperately needed to save lives.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"From Duluth to Hallock to St. Paul, smaller companies and employees are halting production to produce masks, make hand sanitizer, and help in any way they can."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,And you — staying home — are doing some of the most critical work of all.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"I know it doesn’t feel that way for many of you. Minnesotans are hardworking people who step in to help. In many storms, that means plowing out your neighborhood, filing sandbags, or trudging through the snow to check on your loved ones."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Now that means staying home. What you are doing isn’t paralysis — it’s action.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Staying home reduces face-to-face contact and thus the threat of virus transmission by up to 80%..
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Staying home is the only vaccine we have right now.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,You are slowing the spread of this disease. You are protecting your neighbors. You are giving hospitals time to prepare to care for the many who will fall ill.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,You are making a difference. You are saving lives.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"As a dad and as a former teacher, I want to speak directly to our children for a moment."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,I know this is scary. I know you miss seeing your teachers and your classmates. I know it’s disappointing that many of the important end-of-school activities have been canceled. I know there are athletes out there who were prepared to go win state championships on diamonds and fields across the state.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"But what you are doing matters. Your sacrifice is keeping people safe. You are protecting people. Someday when you have children of your own, you will tell them about this moment in history and what you did to help the people of your state. Thank you."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Parents, I know this is hard. Many of you are watching your children while trying to work yourselves. And you’re worried about the bills."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,This is hard for everyone. Take a deep breath. Be kind to yourself. We are all doing the best we can — and that’s all we can do.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Minnesotans, I don’t take what we’ve asked you to do lightly. I served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. I raised my hand to defend freedom and liberty."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"In a democracy, any action to restrict these rights cannot be enacted lightly. But at the moment, they are critical — to save lives."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"My promise is to continue to communicate my decisions, explain when we change course, and never stop fighting alongside you, the people of Minnesota."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,These last few weeks have been difficult — and it’s only going to get harder.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Long hours of darkness are ahead.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We are going to do everything in our power to save lives — and as hard as we work — we won’t be able to save everyone.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,It’s going to be a cold winter. How do we get through a cold winter? We get through it together. As One Minnesota.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We shovel our neighbor’s sidewalk. We push out a stranger’s car. We donate hats and mittens.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,This collective spirit empowers us to endure winter — and it is how we will endure this crisis as well.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,You see it already.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The White Bear Lake Pee Wee hockey team was on the road to New Ulm for the state tournament when it was canceled mid-route due to COVID-19.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"While the season ended abruptly, the team is still a team — virtually."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The players and their parents have started a text chain to check in every night to see how everyone is doing and if anyone needs help.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"One evening, a player’s mom shared how she is exhausted from her work as a nurse and is worried about doing her job without personal protective equipment."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"The next day, the hockey dads cleaned out their supplies of masks at work and in their garage."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,A big box was left on the nurse’s doorstep with a note that said: “Your hockey family loves you.”
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,It left her in tears. Her hockey family is helping her through this crisis.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"This same spirit flows between the high-rises of downtown Minneapolis where people go out on their balconies to clap, cheer, and bang pots and pans to celebrate health care workers when they get off a shift."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"In North Branch, a state trooper pulled a woman over this weekend for speeding."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"It turns out, she was a doctor in town for work."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The trooper noticed some medical masks in her bag that she had been forced to re-use due to the current shortage.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Instead of handing her a ticket, the trooper handed her a stack of masks that he had been given to keep him safe."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"At a state veterans’ home, the grandchildren of one of the residents were sad that they can no longer visit their grandpa."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"They created chalk drawings outside his window not only lift his spirits, but also to thank the staff for caring for him during this difficult time."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"While we may be separated physically, we stand united. From Rondo to the Range, from north Minneapolis to North Mankato, we are One Minnesota."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,And a new day will come.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The sun will shine. The trees will bud. The birds will sing.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Spring will arrive. And when it does, we will dig out. We will do whatever it takes to support Minnesotans and businesses to get back on their feet."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Our communities will forever be changed. Our state will forever be changed. Our world will forever be changed.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will grieve all that was taken from us. But we will also celebrate all that’s given to us.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Unity. Humanity. Gratitude.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will be more united as a state. We will cherish each other’s humanity. We will have endless gratitude for the lives we lead.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,These trying times have led us back to each other.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"We will value those we overlooked before. When times got tough, who did we lean on? It was the nurse. The grocer. The truck driver. The farmer. The janitor."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"We will recognize all that educators and child care providers do for our students, our communities and our economy."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,This crisis shows how much Minnesota depends on our schools not only to teach our children — but to feed them and provide for their physical and mental well-being.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"We will recognize all that public health workers do at the local and state level to detect and respond to health threats, not just infectious disease outbreaks but the many other threats that impact our personal and community health."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"We will continue to look out for the most vulnerable — the poor, the sick, the hungry. Many have stepped up to protect them during this crisis and that dedication to their dignity and livelihood must endure."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We won’t take normalcy for granted. Our modern lives move fast — and this presents an opportunity to slow down and appreciate what truly matters.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will welcome the morning rush getting our children to school.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will smile as we pass restaurants bustling with friends sharing a meal.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will gather again in our houses of worship.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We will have a renewed appreciation for the calming power of a warm embrace.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,We won’t just make it to spring. We will come out better on the other side of this winter.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Because we are Minnesotans. We see challenges — and we tackle them.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,No matter how daunting the challenge; no matter how dark the times; Minnesota has always risen up — by coming together.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Our blood saved the Union at Gettysburg.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Our iron forged the tanks that liberated Europe.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Our farmers sparked a green revolution that fed the world.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Our imagination transformed medicine — and appears poised to do so once again.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The State of our State is strong.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The State of our State is resilient.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,The State of our State is united.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,And our hearts are filled with gratitude for each and every Minnesotan and the role they play in the fight against COVID-19.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Thank you.
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,"Stay home, and stay healthy, Minnesota."
Minnesota,Tim Walz,Democrat,Goodnight.
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Thank you Mr. Lieutenant Governor. As always I appreciate your introduction, but more importantly, I am thankful for your support and friendship over these last seven years. Governor, you and Speaker Gunn have and continue to be exceptional leaders. I can only hope history will properly record your collective achievements for the people of Mississippi. I expect the members of each chamber will join me tonight in thanking you for your dedication and service."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"For the past seven years, another leader has sat upon this stage and endured one grand speech after another—a leader who exemplifies what it means to work not in ambition or conceit, but in humility and service. In the many days between each of these annual addresses, she has gone about her remarkable work being Mississippi’s First Lady: visiting the children of Blair Batson and working to build the most frail among them a forever home; reading to students in each and every county in the state and embracing them all."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"She has welcomed countless visitors to Mississippi’s historic Governor’s Mansion while directing its renovation and recovery from decades of erosion and decay. She has comforted storm survivors and has helped rebuild their homes. Many responsibilities fell upon her heart seven years ago. She has accepted them all with grace and the loving spirit of one who knows her Christian duty, to treat each person she meets with the dignity endowed upon them by their Creator. Her acts have not been completed for compensation, but rather given with a heart of love. She has been a caring mother and now a joyous grandmother, and for 42 years I have had the honor and privilege of having her as my First Lady. I am so very thankful for all she has done for Mississippi. Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady of Mississippi, Deborah Bryant."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Seven years ago, I stood before this joint session in unrestrained optimism for our state. I proposed that night we set aside our petty political differences and work for the good of all Mississippians. In doing so I believed we could then dedicate ourselves to the proposition that we fail separately, but collectively we can accomplish great things. I proposed that night we all Rise Together."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Tonight, we can reflect on that theme as more than just a hopeful phrase or a wishful possibility. I assure you it was not used simply for effect but for purpose. I purposely called on each of you, and indeed all Mississippians, to join this administration not for merely another term of office, but an amazing journey. One that would see dramatic improvements in the lives of Mississippians and the national status of our beloved state among those of this united Republic."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The question of the ages for Mississippi has been and must continue to be ever simple but profound—can we here, in this our Beulah Land, possibly Rise Together? Can a land woven within the depths of tremendous suffering and sorrow be propelled to soaring heights by the world’s great writers, musicians, and entrepreneurs and indeed chart a path to a new tomorrow? A tomorrow that forever casts aside our past of failure and self-doubt to instead accept the crown of achievement? A tomorrow where the world understands a place like Mississippi is a land of promise and possibility for all its people?"
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"My fellow Mississippians, I am pleased to say we have disappointed the doubters. Together, we have proven that Mississippi can harness our inherent goodness to achieve greatness. Tonight, allow me to show you how we are truly becoming the Great State of Mississippi."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"First, we have embraced the idea that effective public education is the most certain way to see a collective and universal improvement in the lives of all Mississippians. For every single year before our work began in 2012, the children of this state had suffered from an all-too-often failing educational system. Now let me be clear, our schools did not falter or fail from lack of teacher dedication. No one throughout our state’s history has sacrificed more to better the lives of Mississippi children than our teachers. That includes, I would suggest, all of the officials who have served in either the House, Senate, or Governor’s Office. Of all the educational reforms proposed by politicians and all the public posturing by those wanting to be the education champion, none has done more than the teachers. They alone have been there in the classroom, often challenged and overwhelmed by circumstances beyond their control, teaching still, inspiring still, and leading children to rise together."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Our gratitude to these classroom heroes and the essential value of public education are why we passed a $100 million teacher pay raise in 2014 and why I now call on the members of this body to join me in giving teachers their second pay raise in five years. Send me a bill to authorize a pay raise for these most critical guardians of Mississippi’s future, and I will sign it."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"At the beginning of this administration, we knew equipping teachers with outstanding training would create historic results for students. That is why we have supported teachers to achieve National Board Certification. We now have nearly 4,200 National Board Certified Teachers, who earn an additional $6,000 per year as a result of this certification. Our support has placed Mississippi fourth in the nation for the number of National Board Certified Teachers."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I am prouder still of the exceptional work of Mississippi’s students. For too long, too many people assumed our students were just not destined for success – that they could not or would not achieve. But we knew better. We understood the innate ability of all children to learn and grow and unlock their own potential if only given the opportunity."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"We also knew literacy to be the foundation of success. That is why we worked so hard together to pass the Literacy Based Promotion Act in 2013. The concept of the bill was basic but revolutionary. It required reading proficiency by the third grade in order to ensure the opportunity for continued learning and achievement both in the classroom and in life beyond the schoolhouse door. My fellow Mississippians, the numbers show us the policy is working—and to great effect. In 2011, only 54 percent of Mississippi third graders were reading with proficiency. With the implementation of the third grade literacy policy, we have dramatically improved student opportunity and thus the future of our state. In the last testing cycle, 93 percent of Mississippi’s third graders were reading proficiently. I believe that time and results will record your passage of this act as the single most successful reform to public education in Mississippi history."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,Further testament to the effectiveness of this policy is displayed by Mississippi’s third and fourth grade students who are performing so well we are now second in the nation for reading improvement.
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Older students are also improving their performance and are becoming better prepared to enter the workforce or further their education. As National Chairman of Jobs for America’s Graduates, I saw not just Mississippi but an entire nation struggling with high school dropout rates. When we first met here in 2012, our graduation rate was 75 percent. Today, 83 percent of our high school students are graduating--the highest percentage in Mississippi history."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Moreover, our work in education hasn’t been limited to K-12 classrooms. Early childhood learning in Mississippi is becoming a national model. The majority of children across this state are in childcare, and for far too long there was little improvement in educating our youngest children. Each year, Mississippi spends $98 million on federally funded daycare to, all too often, simply house these children. The absence of any learning component in most of these childcare centers, especially in low-income communities, was unacceptable. Following the passage of the Early Learning Collaborative Act in 2013, we put the State Early Childhood Advisory Council to work. We implemented high quality standards for early education. We expanded on the good work of Mississippi Building Blocks and began to instruct childcare workers on a basic curriculum that was compatible with early childhood learning programs across the state."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Today, community colleges throughout Mississippi are teaching child care workers, at no cost to the centers, a curriculum that was designed to support the skills young children need when entering kindergarten. This concept will ensure children begin to learn very early in life when their capacity to process information is at its greatest. We all realize that children learn early and retain those lessons and skills throughout their lives. Now Mississippi’s youngest students will be better prepared for school and successful careers by learning the soft skills necessary for any vocation. Mississippi’s workforce of tomorrow is in daycare today.  Together, we can help them become the best in America."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"By 2015, Mississippi was going a step further in helping to restore and support the entire family. Implementing a holistic system to provide more than just early learning, we began to interview parents of children in publicly-funded day care programs in order to match families with other needed services like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We also began to offer additional education and workforce training opportunities for parents. This Families First platform has become a model of success for thousands of Mississippians and one that is being emulated all across America."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"There is little doubt that our education system is far better than it has ever been and headed in the right direction. We now have a more robust system of education opportunities for all Mississippi children including: public charter schools, dyslexia management programs, advanced distance learning, and now even a special needs scholarship program serving the most vulnerable of our children. I thank you for making that possible and challenge each member of this body to continue to support policies that will help us keep all our children rising together."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Unfortunately, a problem exists in our schools today that threatens children of all ages.  It has become commonly known as the active shooter.  Our schools, which once were a haven of security, have become a place of potential violence.  To help protect our students and those who teach them, I will ask you to pass a comprehensive plan to keep our school children safe.  The recommendations come from a year-long study for effective results.  If you will pass and fund the Mississippi Safe School Act, our parents, teachers and administrators will be allowed to care for our children in a safe and protected environment."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Since 2012 when this administration began, thousands of Mississippi’s high school graduates had begun college and left without completing their degrees. The challenges of life caused these students to leave higher education before receiving their diploma. In 2017, with the help of our community colleges and universities, we launched Complete to Compete. This innovative program encourages students to return to higher education and complete their college degrees. Thus far, more than 13,000 former students have responded, and almost 1,600 have returned to college to complete what they started."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,With us in the gallery tonight is one of many completers. A husband and a father of three who took up the call and has earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Mississippi State University. He is the Director of Transportation for the Starkville Oktibbeha School District. Please help me welcome Mr. Kelvin Gibson.
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Of course, the ultimate goal of these education reforms is to nurture prosperity in generations of young Mississippians. A wise man once said that, “the best social program is a job.” The simple dignity of work is transformational, and I have long proposed that a good job for all Mississippians would become a signpost to success. For that reason, we have assisted the private sector in creating more jobs in a shorter period of time than any in our state’s history."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"In January of 2012, our state’s unemployment rate was 9.4 percent. In 2017, we broke a record by dropping below 5 percent to the lowest unemployment number ever recorded. Today, it is 4.7 percent."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The better news is the unemployment rate has been at or below 4.8 percent for 12 months in a row, and real median household income has risen by 8.4 percent since 2011. And just in case you’re not tired of winning yet, we have 80,000 more Mississippians working today than the day I took office."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Our success in growing the economy is demanding that our focus on workforce be sharpened like never before. Workforce development must be and has now become our highest priority.  Dr. Laurie Smith, who has spearheaded most of the early learning innovations in our state, has now, along with Dr. Andrea Mayfield, Executive Director of our Community College Board, begun to transform our workforce development efforts.  Under their leadership, Mississippi was first in the nation to have a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. "
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Our plan utilizes every community college as a Workforce Center of Excellence.  Apprenticeship programs couple students with private companies to help them launch careers in targeted industries in their communities.  These partnerships are keeping Mississippi industries like auto, aerospace, the furniture industry, medicine, and shipbuilding strong. Younger workers are growing where they are planted and living the American Dream right here in their own back yards. These young workers have more opportunity than ever before now. Today, in Mississippi we have over 44,000 job openings just waiting to be filled."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The opportunities created by our economic developers in Mississippi are impossible to describe in the limited time I have with you tonight. The work of the Mississippi Development Authority, with your help and support, has been nothing short of unprecedented. In the past seven years, your MDA team has competed with the nation and the world, and more often than not we have won."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Your support in job creation and business expansion has been fruitful and has a clear and definable return on investment. In the past seven years, MDA has helped create 35,000 new jobs and attracted more than $7 billion of private investment to Mississippi. Ladies and gentlemen, help me thank the architect of Mississippi’s marketing and recruitment success, the Executive Director of the Mississippi Development Authority, Mr. Glenn McCullough."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Once again, the constraint of time will not allow me to provide the extensive list of companies and corporations that have chosen Mississippi as their home or the number of local companies that have expanded. However, please allow me to remind you of some of the most recent."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"As we gather here tonight, Continental Tire Corporation continues to construct the largest plant in their universe right here in Hinds County. At its completion, this plant will employ twenty-five hundred Mississippians, with a corporate investment of $1.45 billion dollars."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"And, as you also know by now, Amazon will open its new goods fulfillment center in Marshall County and employ 850 Mississippians. This innovative company has changed the way the world shops, and its fulfillment center could have gone anywhere in America. I am proud to say Amazon chose Mississippi. Tonight we have with us in the gallery, Amazon’s Manager of Economic Development, Mr. Will Cowsert."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I have assured presidents and prime ministers and chief executive officers that Mississippi works and they have listened. From Tel Aviv to Tokyo, we have traveled the globe seeking investment in Mississippi, and our efforts are paying dividends.  More than 155 international corporations now have a presence in our state. "
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Our exports have increased by more than 259 percent in the last decade, and over the last several years we have shown world leaders that Mississippi is more than just a river.  The results of these missions produce foreign direct investment and build international business relationships, allowing Mississippi to be a part of the global market.  With your support we have shown the entire world that Mississippi works."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"From the outset, this administration identified the value of healthcare for the wellbeing of Mississippians as well as our economy, and our effort to identify healthcare as an economic driver continues. Understanding that access to care must be the beginning of any good healthcare plan. Embracing the fact that a doctor generates a $2 million economic impact to the community, we endeavored to increase the number of physicians in our state. That is why we have put $12 million into badly needed primary care in the most medically underserved areas in our state with Rural Physician Scholarships. This has placed 33 practicing physicians in rural Mississippi, and that number will nearly double by 2020."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"By 2013, the need for an updated, expanded medical school was obvious. With your help, the University of Mississippi Medical Center opened a new state-of-the art medical school, increasing each graduating class to 165 physicians. This expanded campus anchors a growing medical corridor that stretches from the Jackson Medical Mall to Rankin County, and it is my hope that medical innovation within the corridor will continue to flourish now and for generations to come."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"In the piney woods of Harrison County, another medical community is emerging. It now includes a new William Carey University pharmacy school and a Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College nursing and simulation center. The presence of a National Obesity and Diabetes Research Center in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic is also a testament to our collective determination in making Mississippi’s own medical city. "
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The visionary who has invested much of his personal and corporate achievement into this growing medical city at Tradition is with us tonight.  His father was a Biloxi physician, and he has returned to help build this medical miracle in Harrison County.  Please welcome with me one of America’s great entrepreneurs, Mr. Joe Canizaro. "
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"As I reflect on where we have dedicated our time and resources, I am happy to remind Mississippians the state of our state is financially sound and better than we could have ever imagined. State revenues are reflective of an economy that is gaining and expanding. Adhering to conservative budgeting principles, we have reserved nearly $350 million in rainy day savings. Revenue collections have already exceeded estimates by $90 million and corporate income tax is out-performing year-to-date estimates by nearly 16 percent."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"You will also be encouraged to know we have dramatically cut the cost of government by reducing the number of state employees in the last seven years by nearly 5,000. This effort has resulted in a savings of more than $64 million for the taxpayers of Mississippi."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The 2018 special legislative session was the most successful in modern history. A state investment of more than $1 billion over the next five years will fund infrastructure improvements around the state, and a $38 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation will help complete previously unfunded projects in Desoto and Neshoba counties. Thanks to your actions, $50 million appropriated for local bridge repair is available to counties across the state.  This Legislature has given them what they need to replace and repair bridges today and has established a funding mechanism to do so into tomorrow. "
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I am proud to announce tonight that, along with our other 14 ports, the Mississippi State Port at Gulfport is finally complete. This $570 million recovery project was the largest and most complex recovery challenge remaining from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, and it is now open for business."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Last year marked Mississippi’s 200th year of statehood in this great Nation. We celebrated with vibrant local festivities and hundreds of events but also with the profoundly important opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History. Within these buildings lies the story of our state’s rich, and at times dark history, there for us all to examine with clear eyes and hearts turned, full of hope, towards our future. Already more than 250,000 visitors have come to see and learn the true story of Mississippi. Our creativity and our strength; our sorrows and our joys; our richness and our perseverance are there for the world to see. But on this occasion, Mississippi would tell our own story."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"The young lady who has been the driving force behind these outstanding achievements is with us tonight. She has been a tireless advocate of the two museums and of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Her passion for preservation and for Mississippi set her apart, and we are so very grateful for her efforts. Ladies and gentlemen, the executive director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, Mrs. Katie Blount."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Mississippi is recognized the world-over as the birth place of America’s Music, from the Grammy Museum to the MAX in Meridian, we continue to showcase the rich history of the Arts in Mississippi. In 2014, we celebrated a year-long recognition of our artists by declaring it as The Year of the Creative Economy. From the birthplace of the King of Rock-n-Roll in Tupelo to the final resting place of the King of the Blues in Indianola, we placed our marker at the center point of America’s music. Your dedication to the arts and entertainment in Mississippi helped draw more than 24 million visitors and brought in more than $6.5 billion in the last year alone."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Seven years of work and dedication, and the resulting successes, are behind us, but our work is far from finished. One of our most pressing tasks is caring for Mississippi children in the foster care system.  We can and must do more to support the foster children of this state by providing the necessary funding to the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services and ending the Olivia Y legal action against the State of Mississippi once and for all."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Three years ago, you joined me in seeing the need to establish Child Protection Services as its own agency, accountable directly to the governor. This move has allowed CPS to focus on a single mission: providing foster children with safe, nurturing care while either working to reunite them with their families or placing them with a loving forever family through adoption."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I can report to you tonight that CPS is making great progress. When Justice Jess Dickinson courageously agreed to lead Child Protection Services 6,100 Mississippi children were in the foster system. Today, that number is fewer than 4,900 all thanks to improved efficiencies in the adoption process and tireless work in healing and uniting families. We have much more work to do, but what a difference for these 1,200 children to be safe at home, whether with their parents, relatives, or with their adopted families. For those families who are reunited, CPS is working in proactive ways to better assist them, such as developing new methods to help parents released from incarceration better support their children. Perhaps the most incredible success has occurred with adopted families.  The number of adoptions has more than doubled in just one year."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"CPS also works closely with the Mississippi Department of Human Services. This year, child support collections are higher than they have ever been—more than $370 million, an $11 million increase over last year. By privatizing this critical service in 2016, we have assured those who owe child support in this state pay it."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"If we continue to show our collective support for the neglected and abused children of our state, I believe the federal courts will find favor with our actions. More importantly, so will God Almighty."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Imagine, I asked in 2016, if we all worked together to better public education, from childcare to college. Imagine what we could do together if we took the economy to record highs and unemployment to record lows. Imagine if we had a new medical school, a medical city for research and healing and led the nation in telemedicine. Imagine if we could fund more infrastructure improvements and have another world-class port to ship our products around the globe. Imagine if we could help lead the nation in criminal justice reform, while reducing our prison population and saving more than $40 million for Mississippi taxpayers."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Much work remains in this critical area, and this session I will ask you to take the next step in criminal justice reform.  As a former law enforcement officer, I realize some believe our innovations will somehow be soft on crime.  Nothing could be further from reality.  If we hope to ever lower our crime rate, we must start with the 33 percent that leave our correctional system only to return within three years.  If President Donald J. Trump can pass nationwide criminal justice reform through a gridlocked and hyper-partisan congress, surely we can do so right here in Mississippi."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Working together we have accomplished these things and so much more. We have enhanced our beautiful state seal with America’s national motto. For this time and all time the world will know in no uncertain terms that in Mississippi, “In God We Trust.” Thanks to the leadership of the Speaker and Lieutenant Governor and many of you in this chamber, we have protected Mississippi’s religious freedom while not harming one individual or community."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Our right to keep and bear arms, as assured by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, remains firm and steadfastly defended here in the State of Mississippi. And with your unwavering support, we will continue to make Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I can assure you all, this administration will not cease its efforts to rise to new levels of greatness, and before 2020 sees its beginning, we will have more accomplishments and more transformative change. We will go into a new decade filled with even brighter tomorrows. Tonight’s address is not meant to be a point of victory or final accomplishment, but another step, together, toward triumph. As President Ronald Reagan said, “the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of, nor in spite of, any of the differences between us.” Therefore I say to each of you, continue to work together to do the things that are best for Mississippi."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"As you know, this will be my last time to address this joint session.  This is a special place to me. I began my life in public service in this House chamber in 1992."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"I started as a young man, and I will finish as a grandfather.  Over these many years I have seen Mississippi make incredible progress. It may not have always been perfect, but the march of improvement and advancement in our people’s lives over the last 30 years is undeniable.  None of us can accept credit for all of it, but we can all claim the honor of toiling and striving to make our home a better place."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Each of us gets only a finite amount of time to lead – a time determined by our conscience or by our constituents.  My time in leadership will be ending this year, but for many of you your journey has just begun.  Let us join hands and finish this year, and this decade, with a spirit of action and an eye toward the future."
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"Tonight, I reflect on the wisdom of St. Paul.  I can only hope that, like him, “I have fought the good fight, I have run the race, and always keeping my eyes on the prize, I will press on towards the mark.”"
Mississippi,Phil Bryant,Republican,"God bless each of you; God bless the people of Mississippi, and God bless the United States of America."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Statewide leaders, legislators, and special guests …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Thank you for the warm welcome and the honor of being here today to present the State of the State.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,It was not long ago that I stood here and laid out a bold plan for the future of Missouri.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Back then, many were worried about the direction of our state. Some of you were probably worried about how your new Governor would lead and address the problems within Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, because I love this state and the people of this state, I knew I was ready for that challenge … and with your help, ready to chart a new path for Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,A path that would push us to the forefront of the nation by providing more opportunities for our citizens … and make Missouri a destination for others around the country ready to embrace our Show Me way of life.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I also want to thank the many of you in this room and the thousands around the state who had confidence in me, supported my vision, and offered me patience at a trying time for Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Even though it was a challenging time, it was also an opportunity to do things differently, to tackle tough problems, and propose bold solutions … and with your help, we have made tremendous progress."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"That is why I am confident telling you today that the state of our state is strong … and by working together, we will be ready for an even better future."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"One year ago, I told you my administration would take a very disciplined approach to working for the people of Missouri … and that workforce development and infrastructure must be our dedicated priorities."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Focusing on these issues would allow us to not only make short-term gains for our state, but also provide long-term stability and a solid foundation for future generations."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"They were issues that we worked on together, regardless of party or region of the state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, most importantly, after listening to community, civic, and business leaders from across Missouri … I knew they shared the same belief that these issues would help strengthen every community across our state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"In fact, in just a single year, Missouri’s workforce development agenda has caught the attention of the rest of the country."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Other states are now watching us and taking notes, and we are rapidly working towards our goal of becoming the Best in the Midwest … and frankly, the best in the nation."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"For example, through our collaboration with employers, we now have 42,000 Missourians signed up for on-the-job training through the One Start program … 42,000."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We have reached second in the nation for apprenticeships, and we fully intend to keep that momentum going."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Our Fast Track scholarship program has reached hundreds of applications … and I am very proud that these scholarships are primarily used at our community colleges where women make up 61% of the total enrollment.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Another workforce development program I’m very proud of is ASPIRE MO, a 20-week program that helps incarcerated women develop business plans and prepare for successful re-entry into the workforce."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,With us today in the upper gallery is Emily Kirchhoff and Nigaila Gibbs.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Both of these ladies served in the Vandalia women’s correctional center.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Both of them would tell you they made poor choices in the past, but they stand before us today as graduates of ASPIRE MO."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Through this program, they have shown dedication to learning new skills, taking responsibility, getting back on their feet,"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,and into the workforce.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Ms. Kirchhoff is employed at a call center that connects veterans to healthcare services.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Ms. Gibbs is employed at Americold, a storage and logistics company in St. Louis."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"If we are to be a society that believes in forgiveness and second chances, then it is the next chapter in their lives that will"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,matter most.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Please join me in recognizing Ms. Kirchhoff and Ms. Gibbs.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Please know we believe in you, we support you, and we wish you the best in the days to come."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,The opportunities we have provided for individuals to better themselves – and in return provide a more stable environment for their families – will truly change lives long after all of us are gone.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"When we talk about these successes in workforce development, it is also worth pointing out that real incomes are rising faster than any time in recent history."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"More people have more money in their pockets, and the tax cuts at the state and federal level are absolutely having a positive impact here in Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Missouri now ranks 7th in the nation for small business wage growth.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And at 3.1 percent, our unemployment rate continues to remain at historic lows, and has been below the national unemployment rate for 40 consecutive months … another example that Missouri’s growth is strong, and we are on the right track."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Not to mention that the African American unemployment rate in Missouri has dropped from over 10 percent in 2014 to 5.5 percent today.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Our workforce efforts have created over 40,000 new jobs since I took office … 40,000 new jobs."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, more importantly, it is the private sector that is driving these investments, not government."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,And here are just a few examples:
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,The Fortune 250 Agri-business company Bunge announced the relocation of its global headquarters from New York to St. Louis.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Bayer announced it will add 500 new jobs to the St. Louis region, and Pfizer also invested over $230 million dollars."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Boeing secured a $16 billion dollar contract to build the TX trainer, and NGA West just broke ground on their billion dollar campus in St. Louis."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"On the other side of the state, companies like Swiss Re, Faurecia. CVS, and Waddell & Reed have made huge investments in the area."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And of course, Kansas City beat more than 130 other cities around the country to land two divisions from the USDA and over 500 new jobs for the first time in our nation’s history."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Our big cities aren’t the only ones generating new jobs and attracting investment.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Briggs and Stratton is creating 130 new jobs in Poplar Bluff. Dollar Tree invested $110 million dollars for a new distribution center in Warrensburg, creating 375 new jobs."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Nucor Steel, the largest steel company in the United States, is close to production at its $250 million dollar steel mill that will create 250 new jobs in Sedalia, Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Aurora Organic Dairy opened a new processing plant in Columbia, creating over 100 new jobs … and Purina invested $115 million dollars to expand in Bloomfield."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, about one month ago, General Motors announced one of the largest single project investments in our state’s history in Wentzville with a $1.5 billion dollar investment to build midsize trucks for North America …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,And we like our trucks here in Missouri.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This is just the beginning, and these successes will help us build further momentum."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"All of these are shared successes … and show that by working together, our investments in workforce development and infrastructure are succeeding."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I am proud to report we have exceeded even our own estimates, and the result has been better cost savings and more projects for the people of Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As a matter of fact, Senator Schatz and Representative Ruth … I want to thank you for your leadership on getting the bridge bonding resolution completed, and let you know that our first round of bonds was achieved at an interest rate of 1.25 percent."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, what triggered these bonds was an $81.2 million dollar INFRA grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to build the Rocheport Bridge."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Even more to celebrate are the vital grants we have received to complete the MacArthur Bridge in St. Louis … make significant improvements to the River Port in Cape Girardeau … solidify the East Locust reservoir project in northern Missouri … and finally wrap-up funding for the I-49 Bella Vista Bypass in Southwest Missouri.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I appreciate the support and leadership from our federal delegation in securing those funds, especially Congressman Sam Graves and Senator Roy Blunt."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"These projects are critically important to their regions, and I am proud of MoDOT’s hard work to leverage every tax dollar to the fullest and make our transportation system safer for ALL Missourians."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"In addition to these projects, we got an even better return than expected on the infrastructure cost-share program you all passed."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I am excited to tell you that this nearly $50 million dollar investment will lead to nearly $150 million dollars in new infrastructure investment, and an economic impact of approximately $350 million dollars."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,The bold infrastructure proposals we all worked on together have netted $1 billion dollars in new projects for our state.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"There is so much excitement and optimism across all parts of the state … but right here in Jefferson City, we shook things up a little more."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We stopped talking about reform and pushed through real reforms that have changed state government for the better.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Our first reorganization effort of state government took effect this past August, impacting hundreds of state employees."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,These changes represent the most significant reorganization of state government in decades.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This was the right thing to do to make government more efficient, more accountable, and more customer oriented to the people we serve."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As part of our efforts to improve state government, we also successfully consolidated a state prison that will save us $22 million dollars every year."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, on top of this, through greater efficiency, better management, and more accountability to the Missouri taxpayers, we gave our state employees a much-needed pay raise."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,An effort like that does not happen if you don’t have bold leaders who are dedicated to making state government better … so I would like to recognize all of my cabinet members seated in the rear gallery.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Please stand and be recognized.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I am proud of the support and commitment you show this state every day, and it is my honor to serve alongside you."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We have made record improvements in just a short period of time, but I believe there is still more to do and much more we can achieve with hard work."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Of course, it is important to know that these bold ideas are working. But, most importantly, it is about the impact it has on the lives of the everyday people of Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,That is why my call this legislative session is to propose initiatives aimed at building stronger communities … improving education and workforce development … revitalizing our infrastructure … and making government more accountable.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"It is critical to understand that all of these issues provide individuals with more opportunities, strengthen public safety, and create healthier and more stable communities … and I have learned that no one knows more about their communities"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,than the mayors.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Seated in the upper gallery are the mayors and police chiefs of the four largest metro areas of our state.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City … Mayor Lyda Krewson of St. Louis … Mayor Ken McClure of Springfield … and Mayor Brian Treece of Columbia.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"All of these mayors care deeply about their cities, just as I care deeply about our entire state … we all know that Missouri is diverse, and so are the opinions and needs of the people within it."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, regardless of what part of the state we come from, we all want our communities to be safe … and we worry when we see violent criminals threaten our neighborhoods."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,That concern for our citizens brought the five of us together.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Despite our varied backgrounds and differing opinions, we have stayed focused on what we can accomplish by working together, while also showing respect and willingness to listen to one another."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,These mayors understand my commitment to support the second amendment for law abiding citizens.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,And let me be clear …
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"During my 6 years in the Army, 22 years in law enforcement, and as a lifetime member of the NRA …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,I have never wavered in my support for the Second Amendment.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, we all have to understand the very real issue of violent crime affecting our neighborhoods and the potential consequence of doing nothing."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"By working together, we have come up with solutions to help combat violent crime, such as:"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,- Providing greater protection for victims and witnesses.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,- Providing more mental health resources and services.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"- And, finally strengthening our laws to target violent criminals."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We won’t always agree, and there will always be issues we each feel passionately about."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, I am confident that by working together, the potential for our regions and the entire state of Missouri is even greater."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Please join me in recognizing the mayors and police chiefs of Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield, and Columbia, Missouri."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We will continue to promote initiatives that incorporate more mental health resources into public safety … provide more targeted and tactical support for the pursuit of violent criminals … and encourage more coordination among law enforcement.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We know some of these efforts are already paying off.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Between Operation Triple Beam in Kansas City and our commitment of state personnel in St. Louis, Remarkable results have been achieved … including:"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"- The arrest of hundreds of violent criminals,"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"- Gang members,"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,- And the seizure of nearly 30 pounds of illegal drugs.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,With us here today are members of the Missouri Highway Patrol and the Division of Fire Safety who have been part of these efforts in St. Louis.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Please join me in recognizing their hard work and commitment to protecting the people of Missouri.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"These results reflect real progress, and show that by all of us working together – federal, state, and local law enforcement, and community leaders – we can make a difference and keep violent criminals off our streets."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,I also want to point out that we included community leaders.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As Governor, I have the greatest honor and privilege of representing all parts of our state … but I have learned the most powerful voice is often the one in the community."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,With us here today are several members of the Missouri Faith Leadership Coalition.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,I want to thank them for stepping up … leading by actions and not just words … putting their communities and congregations ahead of politics … and helping me better understand the struggles their communities face.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,These leaders are also special to me because I know we all have a special faith …
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And it is that special faith that allowed us to look past whatever differences we may have, and come together for a purpose higher than any one of us."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Would the members of the Missouri Faith Leadership Coalition please stand to be recognized?
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,There is also another special guest I would like to recognize today - Mrs. Bernice Jones.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"By looking at us, you might not think Mrs. Jones and I have much in common."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But one Saturday at a Grill for Glory event, we realized we both have an immense love for children."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Mrs. Jones has 13 grandchildren, and I have six. Being a grandparent is something we both cherish."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I also learned that Mrs. Jones has been involved in her same community is St. Louis for over 50 years, keeping an eye on things, offering assistance to youth, and always serving others."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Sadly, she and I met because of the tragedy of children being shot in the street … but this also made me realize something else very important about working together."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We need to take more time to celebrate community leaders like Mrs. Jones who are making a real difference …
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Not those who are trying to tear it apart and relish in the fear they create by headlines in the newspapers.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"When it is hard to find the light in a bad situation, sometimes a spark is all you need to get the fire going again … Mrs. Jones has been that spark in her community."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"She had the chance to leave, but she chose not to."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Mrs. Jones stayed to fight the fight … and has truly changed lives for the better.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Please join me in recognizing Mrs. Jones.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As a former sheriff, it is important to me that we also give special thanks to those who risk their lives to keep ours safe."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Our law enforcement and emergency personnel do a job that most people don’t want to do, but others expect them to do it."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We must trust them, and stand up for these brave men and women."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"I hope that this legislative session, serious time and consideration will be given to these proposals to strengthen our"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,communities.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"While reducing violent crime is our immediate goal, I strongly believe that at the end of the day, it is about better education and skills to get a quality job … because that is going to be the long-term solution."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Last year, our workforce development efforts focused on new training opportunities for working adults."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"However, in some of our most troubled communities, or any community in Missouri for that matter, our children are the true workforce of tomorrow."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,The most important and impactful time of a child’s development is the early years of his or her life …
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Missouri recently received a $33.5 million dollar preschool development grant aimed at creating a more effective, high-quality early learning system."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"With this funding, we have the opportunity to strengthen our early childhood offerings and better prepare Missouri children for success … which is crucial to the development of a strong workforce."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"In addition to early childhood education, we will also focus on increasing opportunities for high-demand training at the high school level."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We need to ensure our students understand the many opportunities out there, whether it be going into the workforce, the military, a community college, technical school, or a four-year degree."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Currently in Missouri approximately, 30 percent of our population has a four-year degree from a college or university, meaning that 70 percent does not."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We need to move away from the stigma that not having a college degree is a failure, when in fact there are many other excellent education and job training opportunities."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This is why we are seeking $750,000 dollars to certify approximately 12,000 new high school students as work-ready through the Work Keys program."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This is a major step that could open doors to students not sure if college is in their immediate plans, but still put them on a path to greater opportunities."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"In addition, we are proposing greater access to virtual education for high school students, as well as home school students."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We will also be working to expand opportunities through Jobs for America’s Graduates, a program that helps youth graduate from high school and transition to the workforce."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, for our college-bound students, we have secured a total of $5.3 million dollars to increase Bright Flight and A+ Scholarship funding."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We are also proposing another $19 million dollars for the MoExcels Workforce Initiative.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, we can do all of this while increasing school transportation funding … and still fully funding our Foundation Formula."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This focus on training our future workforce has been a true collaborative effort, and I greatly appreciate the partnership"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,we’ve had from the private sector and the education arena.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Many of these changes to our workforce system would not be possible without our teachers … and that is why I also want
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,to start discussing ways to improve teacher pay.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"However, the solution cannot just be asking the state to write a bigger check."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We are going to ask school districts, school boards, and DESE to propose a better plan for our teachers."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Being an educator today is not an easy job.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"By supporting them, we also support our children, their futures, and the future of our state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Here with us today is Missouri Teacher of the Year - Misty Grandel - from Fordland R-III High School.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,No person has a greater impact on our children’s education than a teacher who helps them flourish and grow … Ms. Grandel is a shining example of this.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Please join me in recognizing Missouri Teacher of the Year - Ms. Grandel.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And to all of Missouri’s outstanding educators, thank you for what you do."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,This next phase of our plan will help continue our momentum … but we can’t emphasize workforce development without infrastructure.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,That is a big reason why approximately $5 billion dollars in new private investment has poured into our state … why our unemployment remains at record lows … why we are pulling ahead of our neighboring states … and we must keep up the hard work.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We will continue to build on critical infrastructure … and, we will once again propose setting aside $4 million dollars in disaster recovery funds."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Unfortunately, the flooding we saw last year was some of the worst we have seen in decades and even historically …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But I want to truly thank the work of Senator Hegeman, Representative Andrews, and other legislators for their leadership in their communities during these trying times."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Despite these challenges, we have still made some major accomplishments worth celebrating."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We have proven that we can get through tough times … and together, we are creating a new horizon of opportunity for infrastructure in our state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Some of the most exciting infrastructure investments we will see this year can be tied back to the bold bridge infrastructure plan that you as legislators passed.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,More than 250 bridges around the state will be repaired or replaced.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"These bridges are not only critically important to their local communities, but also to public safety."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"For example, by combining our bridge proposal with federal funding secured by Congressman Graves, Missouri is now on track to significantly reduce the number of deficient bridges in the 6th Congressional District, which encompasses nearly half of our entire state …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,And that is a major milestone.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"One of the benefits of the plan we laid out last year was not only the immediate impact, but also the additional resources it would free up for other critical projects."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,An example of this is MoDOT’s recent announcement of a huge investment to rebuild a substantial portion of I-270 throughout North County.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This renovation has been needed for a long time … and because of our bold steps and MoDOT’s innovation, we have made a real change to this system."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Another very successful part of our transportation plan last year was the cost-share program, and I am excited to announce that we will again be putting another $50 million dollars toward the cost-share program this year."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And before I move on, there is one more very special project that I am so proud to announce, especially in front of Mayor Lucas and our Kansas City delegation … and that is we will build the Buck O’Neil Bridge."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"These investments are exciting to celebrate, and we have been working hard to make them a reality."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We have also been driving greater efficiency and more accountability for Missourians hard earned tax dollars, so that we can reap these returns without increasing taxes."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"By rolling up our sleeves and doing the hard work, we have generated impressive cost savings."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"The single largest area we have been able to find savings is in the Medicaid system, which accounts for over $10 billion dollars – over one-third – of our state budget."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Under the leadership of Director Todd Richardson, a new level of accountability and enforcement have been put back in place – both common sense things expected by the average Missourian."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"The result has been a savings of $84 million dollars, further protecting citizens who need the services most, and taxpayers who deserve their tax dollars be used wisely."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,While some in the press are eager to criticize this improved efficiency – or outright misrepresent it – the truth is that this system has been broken for many years and unproductively serving every Missourian who is paying for it.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"At the same time opponents have been criticizing our increased accountability, they have also been promoting expanding this system."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, the reality is that expanding this system comes at the cost of other vital services such as education, workforce development, and improving our aging infrastructure."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"So, make no mistake about it … the vague proposal they are not explaining or purposely withholding is a massive tax increase that Missourians cannot afford."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,The hard work we are doing to drive efficiency isn’t just by supporting policy provisions.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,It is fundamentally reforming state government and driving accountability across all systems.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This is a major shift from the same old style of government that is often supported, where small changes are made around the edges, but real changes are thought “too big” and too hard to do."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"My administration has and will continue to do the hard work, and the benefit will be for Missouri taxpayers."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"The progress we are making is real and exciting … but, there is more we can do to improve government and promote our state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,We must have real tort reform.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, another simple way we can improve government and promote Missouri is by offering license reciprocity to the spouses of the men and women who proudly serve our country in the United States military."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As a veteran myself, I am proud that Missouri is home to over 480,000 veterans, and I hope that we can bring more to our state."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Allowing license reciprocity would not only help us attract more military families, but also fill critical jobs in our economy."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And Senator Brown and Representative Lynch, I am counting on you to get that legislation on my desk, very soon."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"From the beginning, our state’s economy and future financial health have always been of utmost importance to our administration … and it is our responsibility to pass this on to the next generation."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"So, I have one last proposal I will outline today."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As mentioned before, my administration has been more serious than any other in our financial discipline. We have led by example by again leaving over $100 million dollars on the bottom line."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"However, we can do more …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Which is why I am supporting that we put a cash operating expense fund in place to give our state greater flexibility and stronger finances than ever before.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Since the beginning of our administration, our State Treasurer, Budget Director, and my Chief of Staff have been discussing this opportunity … and I am proud that we can finally make this vision a reality."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"To initiate this fund, I am proposing setting aside $100 million dollars this year …"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, to ensure this savings remains stable, we will direct Wayfair collections into this fund until it establishes solvency."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, we will use the remaining portion to pay off debt obligations, as well as provide another funding mechanism for infrastructure programs done on a cost-share basis."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"This final allocation would both increase the long-term financial strength of our state, and create another consistent funding source to further update our aging infrastructure."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Our pro-growth policies and conservative budgeting are working …
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And together, we can set the stage for greatness for Missouri and our future generations."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,It is no secret there are elections in the coming months. Everyone here is well aware of this.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, I’m sure there are some of you here at the end of your term that feel a little differently about the coming months."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"When returning home to the people you serve, at the forefront of your mind will be what you accomplished to help improve your communities."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"If we thought more about what we accomplished at the end of our time, we would likely spend our days a little differently."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,My guess is that we would spend less time fighting each other over the few differences we have and more time working on the things that we agree on.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"We have all seen what the outcome of this behavior is when we watch what is going on in Washington, D.C."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Surely we can do better.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Surely as the Show Me State, where our namesake inherently promotes action and results over words, we have a higher sense of obligation to work together."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,Some may argue that all these victories are just coincidental … but I firmly believe they are not.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,I believe is it about a commitment to finding a solution while still standing up for your values.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"For me, these are values like my faith … my family … and our nation’s flag."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"And, another value I will always stand up for is protecting those who cannot protect themselves. All life has value, including the unborn!"
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Perhaps it is my gray hair, but I am at the time in my career when what I leave behind and how I leave it is more important than impressing people and worrying about who I am not."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"Make no mistake, in this arena you will be attacked."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"You will have to endure reading nothing but speculation about your motives, your commitment, and your beliefs."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"But, you also have to choose to stand against these attempts to divide one another, and instead be a leader."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"As long as I am allowed to serve the people, I will work hard to make Missouri better and hand it off to whomever follows me in better shape than I received it."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"So, my final call is to challenge each of you to know one another better."
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,This also means that we have to be willing to trust one another more.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,And my hope in the near future is that all of us will be able to celebrate more successes with one another … but the real benefits will be for the people of Missouri and our future generations.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,It is an honor and privilege to be the 57th Governor of the State of Missouri.
Missouri,Mike Parson,Republican,"God bless you, God bless the great State of Missouri, and God bless the United States of America."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 66th Legislature; Lt. Governor Mike Cooney, honored members of the judiciary, other elected officials and tribal leaders; members of the cabinet and my coworkers; my beloved wife Lisa, and our three kids - Caroline, Alex, and Cameron; and my fellow Montanans."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Thank you for the honor of inviting me into the People’s House for my fourth, and final, State of the State address. As has been the case each of the previous times, it is a humbling privilege to stand before you as Montana’s 24th governor."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Six years ago, I stood at this very spot and introduced myself by saying, “My name is Steve, and I work for the State,” I told you I would work hard every day, guided by my values, to protect the state that gave me the opportunity in life to go from delivering newspapers to the governor’s house as a child, to living and raising our three children in it."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"The sounds in the Bullock household have changed over those six years. The sounds of young children laughing and playing have turned into silent eyerolls and exasperated sighs of embarrassment, as those three children have grown into teenagers. While my Dad jokes are awesome... apparently being governor is no longer as cool as it used to be."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Though the household sounds may have changed, they are still a constant reminder to me of the reason I show up for work each day. My family has always shaped my perspective in public office. Because as a father I want my kids, and all Montana kids, to have every opportunity I had growing up here and more."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Six years after our family moved into the governor’s residence, six years after I first had the honor of standing before this body, I am pleased to report the state of our state is stronger than ever."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"The first time I stood at this rostrum in 2013 I spoke of all the work we had to do, and also of the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"At that time, our unemployment rate was 5.6%. Now it’s at its lowest in a decade, at 3.7. More people are working than ever before in our state’s history. We’ve added almost 34,000 private sector jobs since January 2013, while we have fewer state employees today than when I took office."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And real wages are on the rise. Today, the average Montana worker earns 108 dollars more each and every week than they did six years ago. That’s real money."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Families are climbing the ladder of opportunity to the middle class. Montana’s middle-class households grew more than any other state between 2013 and 2016. In 2017 our median household income grew nearly two and a half times the national average, at the fastest rate in the country."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Business is booming, and it’s no surprise. Since 2013 we’ve repealed or revised hundreds of regulations and removed red tape. We cut the business equipment tax for every Montana business, and eliminated it for ⅔ of the businesses operating in the state."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We see Montana’s economic success directly in our communities. Fifteen months ago, we began working with ClassPass, a fitness tech startup, as they were deciding among 29 states where to expand their New York and San Francisco operations. They chose Missoula, Montana.  Originally planning to hire 50 people, we recently celebrated the hiring of their 100th. And the CEO tells me they plan to hire another 100 in Montana this year."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"This economic success is not just confined to the urban areas. We see it in our rural communities as well. Ticketprinting.com has 100,000 customers, and is the leading company in the world for event and raffle ticket printing, and it has a customer service team that works remotely from places like Columbus, Big Timber, and the suburbs of Two Dot. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,We see it on our Native American reservations. In the past six years we’ve made it easier for businesses located within our tribal nations to work with customers and businesses across our state.  And we have funded nearly 120 businesses that have created or retained 220 jobs through the Indian Equity Fund.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We also see it on our farms and in our forests. We rank near the top in barley, wheat and organic production, and lead the nation in pulse crops, doubling the acreage since 2013. Because of the Forests in Focus program, we produced nearly 200 million board feet of timber in the last 4 years, retaining over 3,000 jobs in the forests products sector, and are now working across landscapes, state, federal, tribal and private. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We see that economic success in our outdoors. Our clean air, clean water and public lands are our way of life and a key economic driver. Our outdoor economy generates over 7 billion dollars a year in consumer spending and sustains 71,000 jobs."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And we see it in our vibrant towns. Since my time in office, we’ve helped over 15,000 small businesses expand their footprint through economic development tools created under Governor Racicot. These programs have supported more than 12,000 jobs and are up for renewal this year. I encourage you to continue and strengthen this legacy...for our small businesses, and for the long-term strength of our economy."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Montana has extraordinary economic strengths. The fabric of our communities - our schools, our families, our outdoors, our Main Streets - contribute to our unparalleled quality of life. Together, we can do more to ensure all our cities and towns make up the best state to live, work, start a business and raise a family."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"The most important investments we make as public servants will impact Montana long after we have completed our time in office. Foremost among them is ensuring that our kids, students and workers have a world-class education."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Public education is one of our state’s great equalizers. I would not be standing here today if it wasn’t for our state’s public schools. No matter who you are, where you come from, or what your background is, our schools open the doors of opportunity to all Montanans."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"When I first stood at this rostrum in 2013, I said that we not only needed better jobs, but better schools too."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"At that time, just 2500 students were taking dual enrollment classes. Today, more than 6,000 high school students are taking college classes, saving Montana families 5 million in tuition each year. And this past fall, with the assistance of the university system, I launched the “1-2-Free” Dual Enrollment Program so that high school students can take their first two college classes without paying a single penny in tuition. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Back in 2013, less than three-quarters of school districts had access to high-speed internet. Today 98% of districts are connected to high-speed internet, at less than half the cost. Teachers are using 21st century technology to prepare students in an increasingly technology-driven society."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2013, Breakfast After the Bell was almost unheard of, and over 20% of kids across Montana were considered to be food insecure. Since then, over one-third more income eligible students are getting school breakfast. And we joined with private sector partners in expanding Breakfast After the Bell to well over 100 new schools."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I want to thank those partners, and my wife Lisa, for all your efforts to end childhood hunger."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2013, not a single one of our two-year or tribal colleges was offering apprenticeships with on-the-job training to connect students to good-paying jobs. We now have apprenticeship coursework in seven out of ten two-year colleges, and in five of seven tribal colleges."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And for our veterans, we’ve expanded opportunities to get college credit for prior learning gained through their military service."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2013, states around the country were slashing university budgets and saddling students with steep tuition increases. Instead, we have increased investments in higher education while freezing college tuition four of the last six years; leading to Montana having the fourth lowest tuition and fees in the nation."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We have worked together - across the aisle, across rural and urban, and in partnership with communities, school districts and the university system - to make record investments in our educational system, offering students the tools they need to succeed."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Let’s build upon the progress we’ve made, starting with our youngest learners. Last session, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle worked to provide 6 million dollars to establish the STARS Preschool Pilot."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Part of the premise behind the pilot was to learn whether this would work in our smaller communities. Until Wibaux had a STARS Preschool option, even the closest childcare provider was 30 miles away. In Lewistown, I met a woman who told me she made too much money to qualify for Head Start but couldn’t afford to have her son in the kind of quality program that would give him a great start. If it weren’t for STARS Preschool, she’d have to drop out of the workforce to take care of her children."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In the first year of the pilot - 17 programs serving our largest towns like the Head Start in Billings to some of our smallest like Troy Public Schools - 93% of the participating preschoolers walked out ready for kindergarten. And we know - not just from Montana’s experience but from the other 44 states prioritizing publicly funded preschool - that for every dollar invested there is a seven-dollar return, in reduced criminal justice and social services costs, and increased earnings. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Quality preschool is an investment in our children, in our workforce and for our business community. I’m pleased that the Washington Companies, First Interstate Bank, BNSF, Zoot Enterprises, and other major businesses are forming the Montana Coalition for School Readiness, and will be urging this 66th legislature to make a substantial state investment in quality pre-K."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"They, and we, know preschool works. I ask you to invest 30 million dollars over the next two years - 22 million for public schools through the school funding formula and 8 million for Head Starts and private and community providers through the STARS program. Let’s provide kids and families in rural and urban areas access to high-quality, voluntary, affordable preschool options."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,The future leaders of our state deserve no less. And let’s not stop there.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Let’s once again freeze in-state college tuition and prevent what is effectively a tax increase on 28,000 Montana students and their families."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And let’s finally join 49 other states providing state-funded, need-based financial aid for students and adult learners. If we are willing to provide 5 million dollars for need based-aid, the university foundations will match our investment, better opening the doors of access to higher education to all Montanans."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"These investments - from preschool to higher education - don’t just make a difference today, they will determine for decades to come the economic success of Montana students, workers and families."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Another opportunity we have to impact the lives of Montanans is improving the health of Montanans, our businesses, and our economy."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"When I first stood at this rostrum in 2013, I asked that we transform the way we deliver healthcare, so we can create jobs and take care of those who need our help the most."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"At that time, our state’s uninsured rate was at a staggering 20%; it is now the lowest it’s ever been at under 8%."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2013, we were investing just 75 million dollars annually in community-based mental health, substance use treatment, and services for children, seniors and people with disabilities. Today, we are making record investments in these services, over 135 million each year, plus serving an additional 14,000 adults, children, and people with disabilities."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We nearly doubled the number of Substance Use Treatment providers, while expanding access to 135 locations across our state."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And Montanans now receive equal treatment under their healthcare plans for mental health, as they do for physical health."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2013, there was no consistency in what the state was charged for medical care. At one facility, the State was charged 105,000 dollars for a knee replacement of a state employee - six times more than it would cost on Medicare. Through referenced based pricing, we’ve now made medical costs more predictable, consistent and comparable among facilities. As a result, taxpayers have saved over 13 million dollars in state health plan costs in less than two years."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I will never forget a visit to Choteau for a community meeting during the 2015 session. I remember the hospital administrator telling me that 42% of the people that walked through their hospital doors didn’t have insurance. And the Chair of the County Commission, Joe Dellwo, telling me how that hospital had saved his life, and that, if they lost that hospital, they could well lose their community."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In 2015 we came together and passed one of the most innovative Medicaid expansion programs in the nation. We require those receiving healthcare to have skin in the game and collect around 5 million dollars in premiums each year. And unlike every other program in the nation, we offer those receiving healthcare an opportunity to improve their lives and their employment by connecting with our Department of Labor."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Just as our program is unique to the nation, so too are its results. No other state has increased labor force participation like we have because of our HELP-Link program. The work done in Montana - our work - is a national model that other states are looking to adopt."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Now if I told you I had a business coming to Montana that would create between 5,900 and 7,500 jobs in every corner of this state - that would infuse over 350 million dollars of new personal income into our state - you would all tell me that sounds pretty darn good."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Well, that’s exactly what Medicaid expansion has done and will continue to do."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,And it has also done so much more.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"That hospital in Choteau remains open today. In states that didn’t expand Medicaid, rural hospitals have been closing at a rate six times greater than those that did. We haven’t lost one, and uncompensated care is down 50% statewide. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Through the expansion we passed in 2015, we are providing more than just basic health care. Over 33,000 of our friends and neighbors have received mental health services. Almost 10,000 have been treated for substance abuse."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"It is that healthcare, physical and mental, that allows people to work.  We know in 2017, seven out of 10 Montanans on Medicaid expansion were employed while enrolled. Those who are not employed are growing in their careers through school or workforce training, caregivers for a family member, or are sick or disabled themselves."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"It doesn’t make sense to me that when we have a nationally-recognized model that is helping people succeed in today’s economy, we’d consider any measures that take health coverage away from working folks; measures that cost more to administer than provide the services in the first place; or measures that won’t pass muster in the courts."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And Medicaid expansion benefits businesses in every county - all 56 across Montana - in every industry, and of every size. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Montana legislators reflect the businesses in our state. Some of you own restaurants, fast food chains, or grocery stores. Some of you own construction companies or hotels. And many of you own small businesses."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Almost 9 out of 10 hotel and restaurant businesses here rely on Medicaid expansion to provide healthcare for at least some of their employees. Two-thirds of our Montana businesses in retail, and over half of our construction firms, rely on Medicaid. In total, nearly 18,000 Montana businesses had one or more of their employees enrolled in Medicaid expansion in 2017."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I have listened to concerns from legislators on both sides of the aisle about the need to provide sufficient mental health funding. Without expansion, kiss those gains goodbye. I hear from you the need to support rural communities. The rural hospitals we are sustaining keep those communities viable."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I have heard about the need to support our businesses. With almost 3 out of every 5 of MT businesses relying on Medicaid to provide healthcare for at least some of their employees, you aren’t supporting our businesses big and small if you roll back the gains we made with expansion."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"It is critical that we remove the sunset on Medicaid expansion. That we protect the healthcare for 95,000 of our family, friends and neighbors. That we protect our rural hospitals. And our economy."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Beyond Medicaid, Montanans hope and expect that being covered by health insurance will protect them from financial ruin if they are sick or injured. But sometimes, even having health insurance coverage isn't enough. We can do more."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,I am asking you to lower premiums by as much as 20% for Montanans covered by individual health insurance by passing Senate Bill 125 to create a state reinsurance program.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And Montanans should expect to know what they will be paying for and how much the bill will be, even before they receive medical care. House Bill 152 would protect us from “surprise” medical bills that are all too frequent."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Finally, it makes no sense that pharmacists can’t tell their patients when there is a different brand of medicine that would cost less than even their copay. That’s why we are proposing a measure to put this practice by pharmacy benefit managers to an end."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,We have the opportunity - not only to protect the progress we’ve made improving the health of Montanans and our economy - but to build on that progress.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,The long-term health of our communities also depends on whether or not they are able to sustain the strong economic growth Montana has experienced in recent years.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"When I first stood at this rostrum in 2013, I asked you to take advantage of historically low interest rates, invest in infrastructure, and immediately create thousands of jobs across our state."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We have now gone six years without passing a major infrastructure package. When you take into account increased inflationary costs and borrowing rates, 100 million dollars worth of infrastructure delayed from 2013 would now cost us 154.5 million. Don’t kid yourself, this will only increase over time."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"That’s not to say we haven’t made progress. Over the past six years we have invested 300 million in our communities and at our colleges to ensure, at the very least, we don’t fall further behind."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Those investments have gone to upgrade water, sewers, schools and bridges in all 56 counties. Every single county in our state has gotten a piece of the pie."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Yet, when it comes to a major infrastructure package, each time we have fallen a couple votes short. The failure isn’t because of lack of interest, or lack of need - it is because of the two-thirds vote required for bonding. This wasn’t always the case. Republican Governors Stephens, Racicot, Martz - with mostly Republican-led legislatures, all passed bonding measures. And it is time you do as well."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,What I’ve proposed is a 290 million dollar investment in infrastructure. 
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"In crafting this proposal, I have listened to your concerns. I heard you tell me that too much goes to buildings and not enough to base infrastructure. I’ve proposed more money for horizontal infrastructure - water, sewer, solid waste disposal, bridges and broadband - than buildings."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I have heard you tell me that not enough money goes to rural areas. I included a 44 million dollar grant program for Montana’s natural resource communities, largely, in Northern and Eastern Montana, that are impacted by fossil fuel development."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Look, I understand some of you don’t like the idea of upgrading our historical society or Romney Hall, the university system’s number one priority. Yet, I believe you also understand that both upgrades are desperately needed and both are institutions that we - you and I - are responsible for taking care of. And, because of legislative inaction, both are frankly embarrassments."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Even if, despite the demonstrated need, you don’t like those buildings, recognize this. If we are ever going to break this logjam, we have to provide for rural and urban, for our public institutions and for our smaller communities that cannot pay for their own water and sewer upgrades."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"We rank 47th in state debt, per capita. Other states have chosen to incur reasonable borrowing rather than passing on crumbling infrastructure to their kids. We are out of step with the rest of the country."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Break the logjam. This session, let’s deliver infrastructure for Montana for now and for future generations of Montanans."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Now, you and I both know that the distance between Helena, Montana and Washington, DC is measured by more than the 2,150 geographical miles. We see each other as neighbors first. When making political decisions we still share a common set of facts. "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"By and large, we treat one another with respect, even when we disagree. Our politics are more than a sport, or a zero-sum game. You don’t have to hold a town hall meeting to hear what’s on people’s minds. I know, like me, you hear it wherever you go – at the grocery store, at church, at high school sporting events."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And our campaign contribution limits are among the lowest in the nation and will stay that way, because the U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected a challenge to those limits."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"When I stood at this rostrum in 2013, I asked the members of this body to help me preserve the integrity of our elections and guarantee that our elections will never be auctions. Dark money and outside spending on our state elections was rampant in Montana, thanks to the 2010 Citizens United decision."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Whether you supported it at the time or not, I hope all members of this body take pride in the fact that, because of the DISCLOSE Act of 2015, many of those dark money groups have folded up their tent and left our state."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"And, for those that remain, dark money groups can no longer hide behind their tax status and have to report their spending during the last ninety days of our state elections. We should all celebrate that our elections are more transparent, and closer to our citizens, than perhaps any other state in the nation."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Just as Montanans now know who is attempting to influence our elections, Montanans should also know that the source of that money isn't coming from foreign countries.  I’m asking this body to pass a law expressly outlawing foreign spending in our state elections.  It’s a glaring omission that we don’t have a foreign money ban, as other states have already protected their elections."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Montanans expect that their government will work for them - Montanans, Americans - not anyone else"
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Education. Healthcare. Infrastructure. In these and other areas, Montanans elected us to govern and to serve. To make decisions that do good, rather than do harm."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"A little over one year ago, lawmakers were in the hallways of this Capitol for my first, and only, special session. You relayed to me in the months that followed that the cuts - which many of you in this chamber voted for, and made permanent - resulted in harmful, real-life consequences for Montanans all across our state."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Just as I have every session, I’m eager to work with Democrats and Republicans to ensure we pass a budget that is balanced and fiscally responsible. But let’s make sure the consequences of 2017, and the resulting special session, will serve as lessons learned, not lessons repeated, moving forward."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,I will insist on a 300 million dollar reserve for unforeseen circumstances.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"The difference between reserving 300 million instead of 200 million is one bad fire season, or a 1.3% error in revenue estimating over the next two and a half years. It’s the impact of things we can’t control, like government shutdowns and trade wars, market volatility and investor anxiety."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"A 300 million dollar reserve - one that’s accessible, not requiring we decimate government services before these funds become available - safeguards us from those factors beyond our control, and from repeating past mistakes of eliminating services that our fellow Montanans rely upon."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"To make sure we have that money in the bank, I’m requesting changes that reflect Montana’s changing economy by increasing the revenue the state receives from hotel guests, car rentals, investment licenses, tobacco products, and hard liquor.  "
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Let’s craft a budget that is balanced, funds the services Montanans expect, and leaves money in the bank for unexpected things that might come our way. Don’t send me a budget where the cuts aren’t realized until after you adjourn, and don’t send me a budget where I’ll have to make the cuts due to the failure of this legislature leave money in the bank. Because, if you do, I will send it back."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,I believe the budget I have proposed is a reflection of the values we hold as Montanans. It is a reflection of all of the progress we’ve made as a state these past six years and seeks to build upon that progress with responsible investments in areas Montanans expect.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,And it is a reflection of my optimism that we can create a brighter future for everyone fortunate enough to call themselves a Montanan.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I am an optimist. Six years ago, I walked into this job hopeful and determined. And tonight, I am no less optimistic than I was the first time I stood before you."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,In my very first State of the State I implored this body to act like our kids are watching and learning from our words and our deeds. Because they are.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I’m optimistic...that we can be role models that inspire the next generation. And if some leaders fall short, I am optimistic that our friends and neighbors, our fellow Montanans, will demand better."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I’m optimistic...that we can demonstrate while we may have our differences at times, Republicans and Democrats can still work together in Montana to get things done, without shutting down our government."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I’m optimistic...that we can base our decisions not only on today’s needs, but with an eye toward improving the Montana our kids and grandkids - future legislators and governors - will inherit."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"I’m optimistic...because Montana...this place, its people, its purpose...built for me a world where the improbable was achievable. That’s a story each of us understands, because it’s our story."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,Every kid growing up in Montana deserves that same promise of opportunity.
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"As we come together this session, the state of our state is strong. We as Montanans are strong. And by working together, by following the course we’ve set, we’ll ensure that the Montana our kids and grandkids inherit is stronger than ever before."
Montana,Steve Bullock,Democrat,"Thank you, God bless you, God bless Montana, and God bless the United States of America."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"President Foley, Speaker Scheer, Members of the Legislature, Distinguished Guests, Friends, Fellow Nebraskans, and of course, our First Lady, my lovely wife, Susanne—good morning!"
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Once again, congratulations on the commencement of the 106th Nebraska Legislature.  And congratulations to Speaker Scheer on your reelection.  I look forward to working with you."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,The Unicameral is a unique institution among legislative bodies in our nation.  Each of you has a solemn responsibility as one of forty-nine citizen legislators to represent the best interests of your constituents.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As I begin, I want to take a moment to welcome the newest members of the body.  Each of you brings significant experiences and perspectives.  Senator Arch has a background in healthcare administration.  Senators Brandt, Murman, and Dorn will be voices for agriculture as we work to grow our number one industry.  Senators Cavanaugh and DeBoer have experience in higher education.  Senator Gragert is a 40-year veteran of the Air Force and Nebraska National Guard.  Senators Hansen, Hunt, La Grone, and Slama bring important perspectives as entrepreneurs, small business owners, and young professionals.  Senator Lathrop returns as a seasoned legislator.  And Senator Moser is a small business owner and a former local public servant as Mayor of Columbus."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,Let’s recognize this new class and welcome them again.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"In the coming weeks and months, each of us will use our experience as we shape public policy and work together.  Our republic works best when we find areas of collaboration where we can put Nebraskans first."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As we begin our work this year, I am happy to report to you that the state of the state is strong and growing."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Last week, I relayed in my inaugural address that Nebraska has achieved high marks over the past year.  We are the number one state for fiscal condition; number two for cost of doing business and regulatory environment; we have the third highest wage growth since 2014; we have the fourth best workforce participation rate; Forbes says we are the fifth best state for business; and we have the sixth lowest unemployment rate in the country."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Over the past four years, we have strengthened Nebraska’s place in the world with our four pillars for growth, which include developing our people; cutting the regulatory red tape; controlling spending so we can deliver tax relief; and promoting Nebraska both nationally and internationally."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,This has led us to back-to-back awards for the most economic development projects per capita of any state in the nation.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"In our work this year, it is important to remember that even as the state is employing record numbers of Nebraskans, our number one industry, agriculture, is grappling with low commodity prices.  Since 2013, farm income in Nebraska has been cut by over 60 percent.  Think about that for a moment: When a family’s income falls by over half, you are forced to make tough decisions that have a significant impact on your way of life.  During this session and throughout the year, we must work to expand opportunities for our farm and ranch families."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"We are doing that in the area of value-added agriculture, so more families can bring the next generation home to the family farm.  Last year, we welcomed six new counties into the state’s Livestock Friendly County program for a total of 49."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Layering livestock into the family operation is a game-changer for many families.  Take for example the Schulz family of Seward County.  Three generations of Schulzes have joined us today under the north balcony.  They recently received approval to build a barn to raise chickens for Costco.  Their new poultry operation will allow Joe, the third generation and a recent University of Nebraska graduate, to return to the family farm.  Please help me welcome and congratulate Joe and the Schulz family."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As I worked on this two-year budget, I had one thing in mind: the people of Nebraska.  We have a responsibility to the people we care for and the people who pay the bills, the taxpayers.  Let’s put Nebraskans first as we work on this budget."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"In all my budgets, I have worked to keep the rate of growth at about 3 percent or less.  The budget I am presenting to you today is no different, and keeps the rate of spending growth to 3.1 percent.  A significant portion of this spending increase is attributable to Medicaid expansion and state aid to public schools.  In my budget, state agencies continue to control spending growth with an average two-year operations increase of just 2.3 percent."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Even while controlling spending, we have prioritized new initiatives to help grow Nebraska, recognize the dignity of human life, and protect public safety."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"With this budget, we can do more to help grow Nebraska in three ways."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"First, we are doing more to help Nebraskans take great-paying jobs.  Job creators across the state name workforce as a top priority.  We have a low unemployment rate, a high labor force participation rate, and lots of great jobs. "
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"With the right opportunities, the next generation of Nebraskans can find a pathway that gives them the career they need to stay in Nebraska and enjoy the Good Life.  Take for example the story of Chris Nightser.  Chris started high school with industrial arts classes.  After graduation, he took a job in a fabrication shop, which then led to a career with Miller Electric starting as an apprentice.  He has earned his Associate’s Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, and Master’s in Business Administration while working thanks to tuition reimbursement programs and scholarships.  This gave him over $100,000 worth of education with relatively little debt.  Today, he is the Pre-Fabrications Operations Manager at Miller Electric. "
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Chris’ story is important because he was exposed to opportunities in this field at an early age, and he was able to take advantage of them because of an apprenticeship, scholarships, and tuition reimbursement.  Please help me welcome Chris, who is in the north balcony."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"To help more Nebraskans like Chris find great careers, I am making two new proposals.  As previously announced, I am recommending the creation of the Nebraska Talent Scholarships program to help our community colleges, state colleges, and the university system attract even more students in targeted programs from engineering to healthcare with over 2,100 new scholarships. "
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Additionally, I am recommending the expansion of the Developing Youth Talent Initiative to connect more middle school students to opportunities in manufacturing and IT with an additional $1.25 million annually.  This program has already impacted 7,000 students, and this expansion will help reach even more."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Working together to create more pathways, we can help connect more Nebraskans with the countless great opportunities available in communities statewide."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Second, my budget also takes new steps to make state government more effective, more efficient, and more customer-focused.  Over the past two years, we have worked together to successfully create a Department of Transportation and a unified veterans’ agency.  This year, Senator Hughes and I are proposing to bring together the Department of Environmental Quality and the Energy Office.  Creating a Department of Environment and Energy that will allow the state to form a more unified vision and strategic plan for our work in these related areas."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,Senator Lowe and I are also recommending moving three key safety inspection programs from the Department of Labor to the State Fire Marshal’s Office to better align with its purpose of protecting public safety.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"The third priority we are working on in this budget is tax relief.  Thanks to our work on controlling spending over the last few years, we have been able to build new tax relief into this budget."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,Property tax relief is the number one priority Nebraskans want as I travel the state.  And many of you have shared similar stories with me from your districts. 
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,I have three property tax relief proposals.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"First, my budget provides $51 million in new, direct property tax relief through the Property Tax Credit Relief Fund each year.  This is a 23 percent increase in property tax relief from this fund to all Nebraska property owners."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Second, Senator Lindstrom and I are recommending that we establish a statutory floor of $275 million for the Property Tax Credit Relief Fund.  This will give taxpayers more certainty about future relief."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Third, Senator Linehan and I are proposing to establish a three percent cap on property taxes levied by local governments.  Over the past decade, local property taxes have risen over 57 percent.  To deliver long-term, structural relief, it is important that we limit the growth of property taxes.  Our proposal comes in the form of a constitutional amendment, which must be approved by the people after receiving your consideration."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"These proposals, together, will help deliver immediate relief and structural reform. "
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Furthermore, I stand ready to work with all of you on additional property tax relief proposals, such as Senator Erdman’s income potential valuation bill, which would help deliver much-needed reform to our property tax system.  I know there will be many proposals introduced this year.  As we work on property tax relief, any proposal should help control spending, fit in the budget, and cannot raise taxes on one group of people to reduce taxes on another group."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"My last proposal in the area of tax policy delivers relief for Nebraska’s veterans.  Thank you to Senators Brewer, Blood, Bostelman, Clements, Crawford, Gragert, Linehan, and Lowe for your work on this initiative to help make Nebraska a better place to retire as a veteran.  Our proposal is a 50 percent tax cut for all veterans receiving military retirement benefits.  Five of our six surrounding states do not tax veterans’ retirement benefits.  This proposal is a step forward, which makes Nebraska more tax competitive, so we can keep more of our veterans and their families here after retirement."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,Numerous veterans and representatives from the Nebraska National Guard have joined us here today and are sitting in the north balcony.  Please help me recognize them!
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Another important area that will be addressed this session is incentives.  You all have already started an important conversation about the future of Nebraska Advantage and what the state’s tax incentives should look like.  Across the nation, incentives are an important tool for attracting new investments and jobs.  As you work to reform incentives, I encourage you to keep in mind these goals.  Nebraskans want tax policy that is simple; transparent; accountable; and attracts higher-paying jobs."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"Finally, there are a few more items that I want to highlight in my budget.  My budget implements Initiative 427, fully funds state aid to K-12 public schools, recognizes the dignity of human life, and protects the public safety."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"In November, voters approved Medicaid expansion, and my budget recommendation reflects the vote of the people of Nebraska.  Right now, the Medicaid team is working to fulfill the direction of the initiative to file a state plan with the federal government by April 1st."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,My budget provides new aid to K-12 public schools by fully funding the $103.8 million TEEOSA increase.  This means the formula will provide a record $1.1 billion in annual school aid.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As I have noted before, Nebraska is a pro-life state. "
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"My budget contains the pro-life budget language approved by the body last year.  Furthermore, I want to commend Senator Albrecht for her continued work to protect the dignity of unborn life.  I look forward to working with all of you this session as we represent pro-life Nebraska, and look for new ways to support expecting mothers and our unborn children."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"We must also continue to protect public safety and Nebraska’s communities.  Each year, we have collaborated to bring about important change in our Corrections system.  Together, we have completed sentencing reforms for non-violent offenders.  We have invested in our prisons, and are upgrading the physical plant of our facilities to help deliver the programming we need to reduce the recidivism rate.  We are assessing inmates more quickly to connect them to the right programming.  And we have invested in additional staff and staff retention initiatives."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As you know, there is more work to be done.  While the sentencing reforms helped to control population growth in our prisons, new felony admissions mean our population has not decreased at the rate expected.  My budget recommends an additional 384 high security beds, which will help assist in bringing our prison population below the emergency level set by the Legislature."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"I look forward to working with Chairman Stinner, the Appropriations Committee, and the entire body to pass this budget."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,"As we work together this session, many challenges and opportunities lie ahead.  Let’s roll up our sleeves to connect Nebraskans to great jobs, to control spending, to make government more effective, to deliver tax relief for our veterans, and to cut property taxes."
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,This session and this budget present an opportunity to put the priorities of the taxpayers and people of Nebraska first.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,I ask for your help in enacting this vision to grow Nebraska.
Nebraska,Pete Ricketts,Republican,God bless you all and God bless the great State of Nebraska.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished Members of the Legislature, Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, Constitutional Officers, my fellow Nevadans:"
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I'm incredibly grateful and honored that I have the solemn privilege of serving as your governor.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Tonight I wish to speak with you, not just about the state of our state, but about a plan to modernize and transform Nevada for its next 50 years of success."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Let me take a moment to recognize Nevada's First Lady, Kathleen Sandoval, as well as my daughters, Maddy and Marisa, my parents, Ron and Teri Sandoval, and my sister, Lauri."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Tonight we welcome 20 freshmen legislators.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Twenty years ago, I was a freshmen legislator, so I know exactly how you are feeling."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Will all the new legislators please stand so we can acknowledge your commitment to public service?
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Sadly, since we last met, a great many former legislators have departed."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We lost a Nevada giant in Speaker Joe Dini.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,A total of 19 legislators will long be remembered for their service.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Please join me for a moment of silence in their honor.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Thank you.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"One month ago today, at the final event of the Nevada Sesquicentennial, I helped seal a time capsule that is now buried at the Capitol."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"The contents capture a snapshot of the Nevada family today, to be presented to a 200-year-old Nevada in 2064."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I wrote a letter to Nevada's bicentennial governor for the time capsule. As I wrote, I realized that the success or failure of the governor and people of Nevada in 2064 will largely depend upon our decisions today."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a unique moment in time."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Having just completed our Sesquicentennial, we have proudly celebrated our state's history."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Tonight we begin writing the next chapter of that story.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We must decide if that chapter is about getting through the next two years, or about creating a New Nevada – for the generations to come."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The most recent chapter of our story required strength and perseverance as we weathered one of the worst economic storms in our history.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,These times were even more challenging because they coincided with two long and difficult wars.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Even though some said it couldn't be done, we managed to lay the foundation for a New Nevada:"
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Nevada became one of only six national training sites for unmanned aerial systems.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We attracted Tesla in one of the most competitive site selections in our nation's history.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We became the home to dozens of other national brands who now employ Nevadans in industries of the future – cyber security, medicine, aviation, renewable energy, manufacturing, data storage and more."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"During my first State of the State Message in 2011, Nevada led the nation in unemployment."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We set a goal then of 50,000 new jobs – we have almost doubled that."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today, Nevada's job growth is third strongest in the country, we have cut our unemployment rate in half, and we have the second fastest growing population in the nation."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We are adding good jobs in almost every sector, with business services, manufacturing, health services, gaming and tourism leading the way."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"And yet, the success of our state is inextricably linked to the well-being of our most vulnerable citizens."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"And I believe we have made significant progress in that regard. 3 Two years ago, 23 percent of Nevadans lacked health insurance, the second worst ranking in the nation."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today, that number has been reduced by more than half, to 11 percent, and we are the fourth most improved state in the country."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The uninsured rate for our children has dropped from 15 percent to 2 percent.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Nearly three-fourths of our Medicaid and Nevada Check-Up populations are covered by care management, which saves the state $13 million, and ensures that Nevadans receive timely, cost-effective and appropriate health care."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In 2013, our behavioral health system was in a crisis."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Individuals waited days to access inpatient psychiatric treatment, and emergency rooms were overflowing."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Through the work of the Department of Health and Human Services, the specially-created Behavioral Health and Wellness Council, and many others, there have been dramatic improvements."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Tonight, I thank them."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Pedro Martinez may lead new state school district We also focused on education.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We expanded full-day kindergarten.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We created new programs for English language learners.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We increased funding for special education, supported school choice through the creation of a Charter School Authority, and dedicated ourselves to college and career ready standards and assessments."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Our colleges and universities modernized their funding formula, rewarding performance and success."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We accomplished much in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Because of our collective effort, I believe we now stand at the threshold of a New Nevada – 4 A Nevada prepared to take its place among the most innovative, visionary and well-educated states in the nation."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Although we can never lose our focus on job creation and the economy, we must now turn our attention to Nevada's generations to come, the youth of our state."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I featured them at my Inaugural for a reason;
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"They are incredibly talented, hard-working and determined, and it is they who will live with the decisions we make during this legislative session."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I know this view is shared by all here assembled.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I am relying on the four leaders of this institution – Senator Roberson, Speaker Hambrick, Senator Ford, and Assemblywoman Kirkpatrick to work with me on what must be done."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We have already started, and I thank them for their leadership."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,It's no mystery. Nevada's new companies will need a highly skilled workforce.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our historic industries do as well.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Improving our public education system must therefore begin with modernization, and modernization requires investment."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But our investment cannot be buying more of the same.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We have to own the fact that our K-12 system doesn't need to improve, it must improve."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today's public education system was largely established in the 1950's, when public leaders responded to challenges similar to what we confront today."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Rapid enrollment growth spurred voters to implement the first State Sales Tax in 1955.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Governor Russell and the Legislature went even further, consolidating over 150 local school districts into the current 17, based on county lines. 5 This made sense in 1955. Nevada's entire population at that time was just 237,000 people – roughly two-thirds the number of students in Clark county."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In 1967, educational needs again required leadership, and the Legislature enacted the Nevada Plan for School Finance."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This plan sought to stabilize state funding to local districts.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In that year, Nevada's entire population was roughly 450,000 – less than today's total enrollment in all public schools."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Not only was the Silver State less populated 50 years ago, Nevadans were financially better off."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"From the end of World War II until the late 1960's, Nevada's per capita income was among the highest in the West."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In contrast, today, almost one out of four children in Nevada lives in poverty."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our population is also much more diverse.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Nevada is a different place.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,America is a different place.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The world is a different place.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Yet we rely on the same public education governance and financing models established 50 years ago.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I submit to you this evening that an education system for this century requires bold new ideas to meet the reality of our time.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I am asking the Legislature to join me in beginning the work of comprehensive modernization of our education system to meet the needs of today's students and the New Nevada.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This work begins with our youngest learners.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Nevada has the lowest preschool attendance of any state in the nation.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Thanks to a recent federal grant, and matching funds provided in my budget, we will improve this worst-in-the-country statistic. 6 My budget also finishes what we started two years ago, the expansion of all Day Kindergarten to every elementary school in Nevada."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,These two efforts provide a foundation for the future success of all our children.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We must also improve our students' reading skills.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Studies show that a child's chances of graduating from high school are cut in half if they are not reading at grade level by third grade.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I will therefore work with Senator Becky Harris and the Senate Committee on Education to introduce a ""Read by Three"" bill to help ensure every student is reading by third grade."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget includes nearly $30 million to support this literacy effort.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget also begins modernizing our classrooms through instructional technology.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today, we invest less than $4 million over the biennium in school technology."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget will launch the Nevada Ready 21 Plan.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This plan will put digital devices in the hands of middle school students throughout Nevada and ensure teachers have the necessary training for this new environment.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"As we expand technology, we must take steps to protect privacy."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I encourage this Legislature to work with the various stakeholders to enact legislation protecting student data.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our most troubling education statistic is Nevada's worst-in-the-nation high school graduation rate.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We have to do better.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"My budget includes a new grants program designed to ensure students are college and career ready by graduation – as well as a significant expansion of Career and Technical Education, Jobs for America's Graduates and STEM education."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In total, this effort will make over $20 million available to our high schools."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We must remember that the New Nevada will be different in other ways from 50 years ago. Our students are different, and their needs are different."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The 40-year-old Nevada Plan for School Finance must be modernized to consider the needs of individual students.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"A better alternative uses ""weighted formulas"" where students with differing needs would receive additional dollars based on a percentage of the base amount."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In the second year of the coming biennium, my budget will establish the first of these funding categories in Special Education and then work toward a final weighted formula."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Other categories will follow in subsequent years.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Last session we introduced for the first time additional resources for Nevada's English language learners.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We created the Zoom Schools, and early indicators point to the kind of success we expected."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget doubles our original investment for a total of $100 million this biennium.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But English language learners are not the only school population with differing needs.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget includes $50 million for students in the most impoverished parts of our state.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Their schools require a solution to win the struggles their students have every day.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I propose calling them ""Victory Schools,"" signifying our commitment to help these students overcome adversity."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We have also historically neglected our gifted and talented learners, allocating less than $200,000 per year for these students."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My recommended budget provides $10 million to establish a true Gifted and Talented Learner allocation.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,These initiatives represent a down payment on total modernization of the Nevada Plan.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Legislation this Session will also adjust when we count student enrollment, increase transparency in the funding model, ensure money reaches the classroom, and modernize equity allocation. 8 A hard reality of today's Nevada schools is that they are simply overcrowded and need maintenance."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Imagine sitting in a high school class in Las Vegas with over forty students and no air conditioning.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The need is real.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Therefore, I will support legislation to approve a temporary rollover of bonding authority for the construction and maintenance of local schools, with state oversight."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"While many must recognize the hard truth that our education system will not improve without more funding, others must accept the reality that improvements will not be made without accountability measures, collective bargaining reform, and school choice."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our new investment must come with performance measures and accountability.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We will only pay for programs that make a difference in the lives of students.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I will again support Opportunity Scholarships, giving tax credits to businesses that provide tuition-based scholarships for at-risk students to attend private schools."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Through the leadership of Assemblywoman Woodbury, the Assembly Committee on Education will introduce this legislation."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I will sign it when it reaches my desk.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I support legislation that increases the quality of public charter schools.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"My budget provides $20 million in matching funding to encourage successful, proven charter school organizations to open more charter schools in Nevada."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Based on recent events, I have concluded that local school boards should be appointed, not elected."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Although well intended, some of these boards have become disconnected from their communities."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I will therefore support legislation to provide for the appointment of members of local school boards.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We must also recognize that Nevada's school districts may be too large or too small.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today, they range in size from 74 students in Esmeralda County to over 318,000 students in Clark county. 9 I will introduce legislation that allows local governments to create smaller school districts in our urban counties, and consolidate school districts in our rural counties."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I will also support legislation to enact true collective bargaining REFORM in our school system.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In 2011, I asked the Legislature for a more balanced approach to contract negotiations."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Most bills never had a hearing.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I again stand ready to work with you to ensure that employee compensation is fair, but also recognizes the need for reform."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We cannot expect that governance and financing models alone will address the underlying issues that prevent many students from learning.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Achieving meaningful public school reform also means addressing the environment in which our children learn.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our First Lady has long been a champion for our youth.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"And in recent months, she has focused her abundant energies on hunger in our schools."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Responding to recommendations from the Food Security Task Force, my budget includes $2 million to expand breakfast in the classroom – and legislation will be introduced to leverage federal spending in this area."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"The onset of the internet, texting, twitter, Snapchat, Facebook and other technologies has introduced new stressors in the lives of our youth, without necessary coping skills."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Many have nowhere to turn, resulting in lower grades, school absence, and in the worst cases, violence and tragedy."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The price paid by some is staggering.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"With us tonight from Las Vegas are Mary Bryan, Aimee Hairr, and Jason Lamberth, whose children were the victims of school bullying."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Unfortunately, these parents are not alone. 10 Over 4,000 incidents of bullying and cyberbullying were reported in Nevada during the last school year."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I will work with Senator Parks and Assemblywoman Spiegel, champions of school safety and anti-bullying efforts, to propose legislation this session to reform Nevada's anti-bullying laws."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In addition, a new Office for Safe and Respectful Learning will administer $36 million in grants for social workers in our schools, as recommended by the Behavioral Health and Wellness Council."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Teachers and principals who lead our schools also deserve our support through investment and accountability.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We must empower them.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,That is why I am introducing legislation to strengthen the current pay for performance laws.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We will require districts to set aside money TO REWARD the very best teachers and principals, and to attract them to teach at underperforming schools."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I have also substantially increased the state's commitment to professional development through a Great Teaching and Leading Fund.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"These funds will be used to improve the teaching profession, attract new teachers, and train the kind of school leaders we need."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Finally, we must acknowledge that far too many of our schools are persistently failing."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Tomorrow our Department of Education will release a list of underperforming schools.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The list includes 10 percent of the schools in our state.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Many have been failing for more than a decade.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We must draw a line in the sand and say ""no more."" I am therefore requesting the creation of an ""Achievement School District."""
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This unique school district will manage failing schools without regard to location.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I have asked former Washoe County Superintendent Pedro Martinez to help with this initiative as a Superintendent in Residence with the Nevada Department of Education. 11 Pedro is here tonight, and I thank him for his leadership on this critical issue."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This is my plan to improve education.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We will make investments from early learning through high school graduation.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We will support enhancements in technology, students at risk, gifted students, teachers and principals, school choice, and construction."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We will tie those investments to performance, with targeted grants wherever possible."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,There will be no blank check.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We will revise collective bargaining laws.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We will also modernize and transform the system.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,And we will ensure that our students are ready for success in college and careers.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Today, only one out of three Nevadans have the benefit of education or training after high school."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Yet we know the jobs of the future will require two-thirds of us to have post high-school credentials.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"The New Nevada will need more scientists, machinists, engineers, computer programmers, welders and other STEM workers to grow our new industries."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our colleges and universities are the key.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Last session we took steps to introduce performance funding to the Nevada System of Higher Education.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"The institutions responded, and tonight, I am pleased to announce additional investments in our colleges and universities."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"My budget includes new operating funds in the amount of $76 million for higher education, plus $24 million in bond funding for capital construction."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The Nevada System of Higher Education sees a growth of over 8 percent in State support over the next budget cycle.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,A UNLV hotel school is funded with $24 million. 12 There is absolutely no reason why the best hotel school in the nation should be anywhere but Las Vegas.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Las Vegas also needs a medical school.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,It is the largest metropolitan area in the nation without one.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The Board of Regents has recognized this need and I am pleased to provide the first $9.3 million for the initial costs of establishing the new UNLV medical school.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Although we will establish a medical school at UNLV, Nevada needs more doctors now."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget includes $10 million in new funding for graduate medical education to attract and retain the best new doctors in America to train and stay in Nevada.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,All in – from preschool through graduate school.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The proposals I have outlined tonight will invest $882 million in education in our state over the next two years.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not make these proposals lightly."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I know they represent a change in the way we approach education.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But I also know that our system has to improve and that every child deserves the opportunity to succeed.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"This investment in our children and transformation of our education system is absolutely necessary, and so, tonight, I ask for your help in creating the funding base to pay for it."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"For four years, we have held the line on spending."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Temporary revenue measures, cuts, and efficiencies were necessary – we sought to get Nevada working again, and we did it."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Businesses were able to get back on their feet and plan for the future.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We also cut red tape and improved State Government. 13 Yet caseload growth, school enrollment, and infrastructure needs place new pressures on State spending every single day."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In the current fiscal year, despite an improving economy and record job growth, we would be unable to pay our bills without significant adjustments to the approved spending plan."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This year alone we are $150 million below forecasts – in a time of economic recovery.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our current revenue structures do not keep up with growth.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The Economic Forum set available General Fund revenues for the next biennium at approximately $6.3 billion.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our current biennial budget is $6.6 billion.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"For the coming budget cycle, the Forum projects General Fund revenues will only be slightly more than the 2005-2007 budget – ten years ago! By contrast, in the same decade, Nevada's population increased by SOME 335,000 people, K-12 enrollment increased by OVER 55,000 students, and the number of Nevadans in many social service programs more than doubled."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The budget I am proposing includes $7.3 billion in General Fund spending – significantly less than agency requests.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But it begins the strategic investment in the education that we require.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I believe this is necessary, even critical, for our future."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We must also consider Sensible reform to the Public Employee Retirement System and the way we pay state employees.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"My budget will no longer require state employees to take furloughs. 14 State employees have made great sacrifices, and i thank them for their service to the people of Nevada."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Tonight I am asking this legislature to work with me to ensure that Nevada moves forward.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"To close the gap between proposed revenue and projected spending, I am offering a two-part solution."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Like so many of these new proposals, it provides an opportunity for modernization."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"First, the so-called ""sunset taxes"" must be continued to cover basic expenditures."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,They provide revenue not only for the General Fund but also the Distributive School Account.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,It's time we are honest with ourselves —these revenues are now a part of our comprehensive budget.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Second, we must identify new sources of revenue."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"$132 million can be found through changes to existing state law, and this will help address some structural issues."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But we must fully fund the education initiatives I have outlined.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I am therefore proposing a broad-based solution that asks Nevada business to invest in our education system.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"By modifying the existing Business License Fee to a graduated scale, we will generate over $430 million in the next two years – funding equal to the investment in Pre-K through twelfth grade that I am proposing in this budget."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I realize these decisions are difficult.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I know I am asking a lot from the business community.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"But I have explored every option and find this to be the broadest, least complicated, and fairest solution."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Business License Fees will be immediately available, something that is critical for our budget."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,And this revenue will grow as the economy grows in the years ahead.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I know this approach will cause debate. 15 You will all find that there is no perfect solution.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"What we must all agree on is that another generation of YOUNG Nevadans cannot move through our schools without more resources, choice and reform -- and that we must modernize our revenue system."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Together we must establish a plan to continually improve the Silver State.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We have an opportunity to show that Nevada leads.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Nevada is poised to lead the nation in the technology sector.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"My budget includes funding to re-ignite the Governor's Office of Science, Innovation and Technology."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"It will bring focus to our STEM strategy and coordinate broadband connectivity so that our schools, telemedicine, and communities have the necessary access to fiber technology."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,It will also administer STEM Workforce Challenge Grants as envisioned by the recent Brookings Institute report.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,And tonight I am pleased to announce the expansion of one of Southern Nevada's homegrown technology companies.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Switch, the world's largest data center, is poised to expand to Northern Nevada, bringing $1 billion of investment with it."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Switch also plans 1 million square feet of new data center space in Las Vegas, for a total investment of $2 billion."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This will make Nevada the most digitally connected state in the nation.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The list of companies wanting to do business in Nevada keeps growing.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But Nevada's unemployment rate is still too high.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Much of the persistent unemployment can be attributed to construction jobs, which were cut in half in the last recession."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Getting housing construction back to pre-recession levels would create thousands of new jobs.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I am calling on the Legislature to pass reasonable construction defect reforms to revive our housing market, and bring new jobs to Nevadans. 16 We can lead by spurring construction in other areas as well."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"The Department of Transportation's Project NEON will invest $250 million to improve southern Nevada's I-15, reduce congestion, and create construction jobs."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Other statewide projects will use another $230 million for construction, maintenance, and future planning."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"In Las Vegas, the Convention and Visitors Authority is helping us remain competitive with the proposed Global Business District."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"This District will add crucial new technology that conventions demand, and it will add new trade show space that could generate $700 million in economic impact every year."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,This project is critical to maintaining Las Vegas as the entertainment and convention capital of the world.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Threats to the sagebrush ecosystem, and the resulting potential impacts to Nevada's wildlife, agriculture and mining, offer another area where Nevada can lead."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I will continue to support Nevada's cutting edge plan to protect our habitats and avoid a listing of the Greater Sage Grouse.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our long history of cultural preservation provides another opportunity for Nevada to lead.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget includes funding to begin planning for the Stewart Native American Historic Experience.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"This project will restore the Stewart Indian School in Carson City, and create a one-of-a-kind Cultural Welcome Center focusing upon our Nevada tribes."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Tribal leaders are with us this evening and I thank and welcome these heads of state to this chamber.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I am keenly aware that Autism Spectrum Disorder impacts 1 in every 68 children.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Estimated projections indicate nearly 6,000 children in Nevada have Autism Spectrum Disorder."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We must meet the needs of these children as early diagnosis and treatment have life changing consequences. 17 Through increased state support and better use of federal resources, overall funding will increase from $1.8 million when I took office, to $73 million."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My administration is also proposing to centralize eleven agencies within the Department of Business and Industry into a convenient one-stop shop – the Nevada State Business Center.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"This Las Vegas complex will reduce costs, and provide better service to our business community."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Nevada also leads through service.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I proclaimed 2014 to be the ""Year of the Veteran."""
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"This was part of the Green Zone Initiative, Nevada's nationally recognized veterans services effort."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Over the last two years, our veteran's cemeteries have received millions of dollars in grants to continue to provide dignity, honor, and respect for our fallen."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We doubled the number of veterans' service officers, and as a result, Nevada veterans have received an additional $50 million annually, tripling the amount from three years ago."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Unfortunately, Our Southern Nevada Veterans Home is at capacity, and Northern Nevadans have no veteran's home of their own."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,My budget contains $14 million in bond funds to build the Northern Nevada Veterans Home.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Our veterans deserve nothing less.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Seated among us tonight are six veterans, Each representing a different conflict from our nation's history, and they embody the spirit of how Nevada Leads:"
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Radioman 1st class bill parsons of sparks served in the us navy submarine service during World War II.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Retired First Sergeant Chuck Harton of Reno served in World War II and Korea.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Erwin ""Moe"" McQueen of Ely served as an Army Infantryman in Vietnam."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Air Force Master Sergeant BJ Jefferson of Las Vegas served during the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Amy Wallin of Reno served in the Coast Guard during the Global War on Terrorism.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,NATIONAL GUARD Captain Denisse Ramos of Las Vegas 18 deployed three times—twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Please join me in thanking these American heroes.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, Nevada stands at a threshold."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"We live in a state that is transforming before our eyes – with 21st Century companies, jobs and technologies that place us at the forefront of innovation and the new economy."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,yet we still operate with decades-old funding systems and an education structure that will eventually grind us to an inevitable halt.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I know we have the ability, willingness, and determination to do what is necessary."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We all want to tell our grandchildren that we were the architects of the New Nevada – that we were here when Nevada needed us most.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,Those before us rose to the challenges of their time and built the foundation of the state we love.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,The Sesquicentennial celebration highlighted those achievements.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"But tonight, as we close the chapter on 150 years of history, this is our time and we must resolve to make our own history."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I am a son of the Silver State.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I love our people, I'm proud of who we are, and I'm optimistic about what we can become."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I truly believe Nevada's best days are yet to come.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I know you feel the same way.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We may stand for different causes.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We may wear different political jerseys.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,We may have different beliefs.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,But we are united in our desire to move Nevada forward with a transformed education system; a healthy citizenry; safe and livable communities; a vibrant economy; 19 and an efficient and responsive state government.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"With our spirit of perseverance and courage, we must dare to write the next chapter of the Nevada story."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"A story that Nevadans in 2064 will look back on and say, ""they did it right."""
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I ask us all to rise above that which seems easy.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,I ask us to lead.
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"I ask us to lead, so that the new Nevada can lead."
Nevada,Brian Sandoval,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great State of Nevada."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Good Afternoon – Mr. Speaker, Madame Senate President, honorable members of the House, the Senate, the Executive Council, Commissioners, and of course, members of the Supreme Court — and our fellow citizens joining us today, WELCOME!"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Today, I stand before you to deliver the State of the State. To update you on where we are, and where we will go. "
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,You've heard me say it before. New Hampshire does things differently. We challenge ourselves to find innovative solutions. We don't subscribe to a one-size fits all approach and that has allowed our State to be stronger and better than ever before.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"When New Hampshire's people do it New Hampshire's way, we set the course and provide a great model for the entire nation. We don't get bogged down like the dysfunction in Washington. We work together — whenever possible — to make sure our state is the best it can possibly be."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And this past week, the Granite State took that responsibility once more as the eyes of the world were upon us."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"In a year with high stakes, we saw record turnout in our First in the Nation Primary."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"It isn't the Governor, Legislature, or political parties that deliver a successful primary – but our city and town officials, moderators, clerks supervisors of the checklist, and the hundreds of Granite Staters who help out on Primary Day"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"AND ESPECIALLY: Bill Gardner, Dave Scanlon, and the great team at the Secretary of States office – WE SAY: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"NH isn't one to follow the whims of other states – other states follow us. When times are good, we do not raise taxes and create bureaucracy – we create opportunity. Doors of opportunity that solve problems. We problem solve, innovate, and get the job done."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,In just the last year we:
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Stopped unnecessary new taxes
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Eliminated the Merrimack tolls once and for all
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Legalized sports betting
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Took historic action to protect our environment
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Prevented business tax increases
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Made record investments into our education system, child protection programs, and the mental health"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Fully funded the Developmental Disability waitlist,"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Ended the order of selection in our Vocational Rehabilitation Program,"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Lowered health insurance costs
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,and Ensured health insurance protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,2019 was a banner year for the New Hampshire economy.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Over the last year, New Hampshire families have benefited greatly from record levels of economic growth. Our focus on our workforce, while making high-paying, quality jobs available has paid enormous dividends."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Business taxes are at their lowest this century, and more people are working than ever before. The model works — and it's proven."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"In just the last year and in study after study, New Hampshire has been recognized on a national level for our unparalleled quality of life."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We are the number one state for economic freedom.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We have the lowest poverty rate in the nation.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,The number one state for taxpayer return on investment
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And the number one state for opportunity.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We must increase opportunity for all, and build a workforce for everyone, at every stage of life."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,My administration has taken on the task of ensuring we are leaders in developing a 21st century workforce.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"As part of a strong economy and workforce, we must ensure that everyone is treated with fairness and respect. As part of that effort, I have asked Senator Jeb Bradley to sponsor the New Hampshire Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which will ensure that pregnant women are treated fairly on the job and are provided with reasonable workplace accommodations. No woman should be forced out of a job or denied employment opportunities simply because she is pregnant."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And at the same time, we must provide greater flexibility in our workforce. That's why we established our Infants in the Workplace Initiative, one of the first in the country – which will allow state employees to bring their infants to work in the early stages of life, which will keep our state competitive and provide immense benefits to family."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Another area where we have great opportunity is Paid Family Leave. Senator Jeb Bradley's bill – which I wholeheartedly SUPPORT – has been vetted by insurance officials and is the only shot at delivering a viable voluntary paid family leave program that does not contain an income tax. Let's not miss this opportunity & get it done for our citizens.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Just last year, while states like Connecticut, Vermont and Massachusetts saw decreases in population, New Hampshire saw an increase."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,These workforce initiatives are more critical than ever because we are now ranked as the most popular destination in the Northeast for millennials and if we want to keep up that momentum it is these game-changing initiatives that will be critical.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Our record of success is no accident – it has happened as a result of our deliberate pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"From your prices at the gas pump to taxes and energy costs, I fought against raising costs on our citizens. It wasn't always easy, but it was the right thing to do. I strongly urge you, my friends in the legislature, to continue with me down this path."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"As you know, much of the 2019 Legislative Session was consumed with our state's budget negotiations. Both sides worked over the summer in good faith to secure a budget that works for New Hampshire. Members from both parties came together and worked out a compromise that everyone could be proud of."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"The budget was a big win for New Hampshire families – we held the line on taxes, returned cash to cities and towns for property tax relief, and provided historic investments into our education system."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"The budget did not make financial promises that could not be kept, and that is something the people of New Hampshire can be proud of."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Budgets serve as roadmaps for the future – which is why we made historic investments into our education system.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"In 2019 – even before this new budget – New Hampshire invested more money per pupil on public education than at any time in history.& And with our strong economy, our new budget does even more."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We sent $62 million back to local school districts for school infrastructure projects
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican, We restored stabilization grants to school districts across the state
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We increased funding for full-day kindergarten
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Fully funded special education aid.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We froze the tuition at the University and Community College Systems
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Doubled our nursing programs at UNH and restarted the long absent LPN nursing program at our Community Colleges
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Despite these amazing education investments, an individual's educational path does not always fit in the traditional four walls of a classroom."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We have to be bold and allow our system to be flexible around the needs of the student.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Last year we announced the creation of the New Hampshire Career Academy – an innovative program that allows for students in New Hampshire schools to receive a high school diploma, associate's degree, and a guaranteed job interview – All at no extra cost to the student or taxpayer."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And just last week, we officially opened enrollment in the program at our community colleges. Students can start signing up now. This initiative is a win for students, families, and the businesses that power our economy."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We also continue to push the limits on early childhood education. If you want to build the best workforce, it starts with providing the best education at the earliest stages of life."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,My approach since day one has been to increase family engagement in every setting.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"So last year, I proposed a $6 million one-time cash infusion into UNH to rebuild the Early Childhood Center of Excellence to serve as a model for the rest of the country and ensure that New Hampshire never again falls behind the curve for our kids."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Unfortunately, this investment was removed from the budget by the Legislature. But undeterred, the state worked with UNH and The NH Charitable Foundation to secure a $26 million federal grant for Preschool Development, the biggest of it's kind which will build capacities for learning and wellbeing at home, in child care, and community based settings."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,This investment is unprecedented and will help the UNH Early Childhood Center of Excellence become that gold standard of innovation we envisioned.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,It's a win we can all be proud of.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And when it comes to education we know we have to work at both ends of the spectrum. Last year, I budgeted for a $160 million, ten year investment in student debt relief that would have cost the taxpayers nothing. Unfortunately the legislature killed that proposal, but I am hopeful we can find compromise and finally deliver this opportunity to provide student debt-relief and direct scholarships — again, at NO expense to the taxpayer."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"This opportunity for graduating students, along with our workforce housing legislation which are moving through the House now can help ensure when retain our students to be the workforce of tomorrow. I am thankful to have bipartisan support for these efforts, and I am confident we will get this done."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"There are many things that the people of New Hampshire take pride in. Our high quality of life, our low cost of living and our Live-Free-Or-Die spirit. But another area in which we all have a stake in, and all have a deep appreciation for, is our environment. Here in New Hampshire, we take the obligation of environmental stewardship very seriously. That stewardship does not just take the form of more spending on yesterday's ideas. We have the responsibility to be smarter and more innovative in our approach. Weighing the impacts, large and small, and not just committing to what is politically convenient. "
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"My administration began an aggressive approach to environmental responsibility first by taking on the issue of clean drinking water. Ensuring that a problem did not become a crisis, and with the leadership of Senator Chuck Morse the Clean Drinking Water Fund was established and to date the state has awarded over $100 million of clean drinking water infrastructure projects to cities and towns around the state."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We then set out giving our best and brightest to the task of creating the most accurate, science-based drinking water standards in the country. Standards based on the best available data and standards that are allowing Gordon McDonald and his team at the Attorney General's office to lead the nation in holding these polluting companies accountable. They are fighting for NH families and we are going to win this battle."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Then you add in all of the common sense environmental measures we have taken:
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Banning oil drilling off our pristine Seacoast - we got it done
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Using the strongest offshore winds in the country for clean renewable energy - we're moving forward.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Dozens of new electric charging stations around the state coming on-line
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And when other states tried to shake down our residents for hundreds of millions of dollars in a gas tax – known as TCI – a scheme to pay off their failing public transportation systems, New Hampshire was the first to stand up and say ABSOLUTELY NOT!"
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"I'd like to take a moment and take a step back to some core issues that we've been discussing since day one, have made great strides in, but we know there is still so much to do with issues of Addiction and drug use."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"It continues to afflict our communities – no one is left untouched by this crisis. In 2017, we knew that we had to take bold and innovative steps to make a difference. The federal government provided New Hampshire with the opportunity to take a whole-new approach to fighting addiction when it awarded New Hampshire an unprecedented $55 million grant to create a new system."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"One year after getting it up and running, the Doorway is a success. Addiction treatment providers – the spokes in the hub-and-spoke delivery system – They agree the Doorway is working. It has ensured that we have statewide distribution of Narcan and access to Medication-Assisted Treatment not just in the southern tier, but throughout New Hampshire. People are entering treatment, services are better coordinated and lives are being saved. Those communities that have embraced and worked collaboratively with The Doorway have seen incredible results. This new system has served over 7,000 individuals in just the first year with the number of overdose deaths continue to fall."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"But the only way to truly solve this crisis, is with Prevention. I want to take a moment to thank Patrick Tuffs of Granite Untied Way, who leads the Governor's Commission On Alcohol and Other Drugs, and the entire Commission itself who this year made the largest investments into prevention programs New Hampshire has ever seen. Millions of dollars into school programs, workforce initiatives and community centers."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We owe you a big Thank You!
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We all know that a critical issue facing our citizens, especially our senior citizens, is the cost of prescription drugs. We know must lower our prescription drug prices, and it starts with allowing the importation of drugs from Canada, greater transparency in pricing and preventing price gouging of low-income families. I want to thank everyone in the legislature involved with those efforts for helping move the bipartisan bills along. Please get them to my desk so we can get these initiatives moving forward and provide some relief to our citizens."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,I also believe there is another big challenge that our state faces. It is rarely discussed but has great impact on the care of our seniors. Specifically those who are waiting for placement in assisted living facilities or nursing homes.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,It is a fact that NH is a state with an older population which has given us the advantage of constantly being ranked as having one of the most educated and experienced workforces in the country.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"But with that comes the challenge of long term care services for seniors. No one would deny that they deserve the highest quality care in the least restrictive environment, within a system that supports their needs. Unfortunately, too often their only choice is to live in a hospital bed for an extended period of time because there are no other options available while they wait for appropriate long term care."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,I always say that governments biggest responsibility is create doors of opportunity for our citizens. ALL of our citizens. We cannot wait for the current challenges surrounding senior health care turn into a crisis.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"I believe government – local, county and state - should be removing barriers to access and opening up those doors of opportunity, especially for senior citizens. So today, I am announcing the formation of a working group, led by our new Commissioner of Health and Human Services, Lori Shibinette. Their charge will be to immediately begin to work with stakeholders and within 90 days provide the ideas and solutions to get long term care back on track in New Hampshire. Thank you Commissioner Shibinette for taking this on."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"When I took office, I called the state of mental health in New Hampshire our unspoken crisis. We have taken mental health out of the shadows, and brought it to the forefront. So many people deserve credit for that undertaking, tackling the core issues and making meaningful strides."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Rebuilding our mental health system has been a priority since day one and I still believe we can become the best state in the country for community based mental health services. We've made investments and I am pleased to have data showing that our efforts are paying off.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We brought in a first-class team and they are delivering results. It has taken a lot of hard work and cooperation to get to the point that we finally have a significantly declining waitlist at New Hampshire Hospital.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Since taking office the average length of time an individual patient waits for an admission has been nearly cut in half.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"In the last two years, the number of days that patients spent waiting in hospital emergency departments decreased by 60%."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We've added dozens of new Designated Receiving Facility beds across NH.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,We've ensured suicide prevention training in our schools
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Mental health services for kids are being provided in appropriate facilities
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And after 20 years of talking about it we are finally moving forward with building a state Secure Psychiatric Unit to give those patients the dignity they deserve.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Another area we are making strides in is suicide prevention for our veterans. It's on us to make sure that we stand for those who stood tall for us defending the freedoms we enjoy every day.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Today, I am proud to announce that the state of New Hampshire is partnering with the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs to combine, and streamline all of our resources, to put suicide prevention for our veterans at the forefront."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"This new effort will allow us to share best practices and join forces. As part of this effort, the first order of business is reaching out to every single New Hampshire veteran, to let them know every federal and state resource available to them and ensure there is no wrong door to getting mental health services."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,They are not alone!
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"As we come into this next year I ask you to be very reflective of what New Hampshire is all about. While the rest of the country is drowning in national negative political rhetoric, let's reflect on how we here in NH do it a little different and a lot better."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Let's remember what brings us together and brings out the best in one another. 
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,There are a few people who I invited to join us today that I really think exemplify that strength.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We all remember the horrific crash in Randolph back on June 21st, that took the lives of seven motorcycle riders, the Jarheads – A motorcycle club of Marines."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And with us today are Manny Riberio and Dawn Brindley, survivors of that tragedy. Manny and Dawn – Thank you so much for being here today with your strength and spirit."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Following that crash there was a small group of individuals that decided to do a memorial ride in the honor of the victims. And I've asked the organizers of the Ride for The Fallen Seven to join us today as well:
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Brian DeSimone
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,Steve Allison
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And Bob Wagner
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"The amazing story is this. The organizers were hoping a couple hundred riders might come out to join them. The ride quickly became so popular and met with such overwhelming response. Soon, thousands of riders were looking to come to the Granite State."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And our teams got together and some said it was going to be too much, not enough time to plan, great idea but it would be too overwhelming to manage."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"But that's not who we are, and that's not what we did."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"We all knew how important this was for not just the riders but for the entire state. This was a moment to drop everything, come together and get it right. The organizers, our state police, emergency management, DOT, and local police and fire departments."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And when the time came it worked. Roads were shut down. American Flags were flying from overpasses above the highways. Granite Staters were lined up along the roads saluting the thousands of memorial riders. It was awe-insipiring.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And that's the spirit I want us to remember. Everyone coming together and appreciating that the job is bigger than ourselves.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"It's not about us, it about those we serve."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,And those who served before us.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,I believe we all share the same pride in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"And when come together as a state, we do it better than anyone. Washington could learn a thing or two from us up here. We don't spend countless days locked in gridlock, we roll up our sleeves and get to work."
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,There is so much more we still have to accomplish. Let's Get It Done.
New Hampshire,Chris Sununu,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great State of New Hampshire."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Lieutenant Governor Oliver, Senate President Sweeney, Assembly Speaker Coughlin, Majority Leaders Weinberg and Greenwald, Minority Leaders Kean and Bramnick, members of the Legislature, Chief Justice Rabner and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, former governors Florio, McGreevey, and Codey, distinguished faith leaders, honored guests, and fellow New Jerseyans."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I had planned to give a very different speech today but, after reading the audit of New Jersey’s corporate tax incentives released last week, this is not a time for business as usual."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"One year ago, tomorrow, I took the oath of office as New Jersey’s 56th governor. Three days later, on January 19, 2018, I ordered a full and complete audit by State Comptroller Degnan of our tax incentive programs — it was one of my highest priorities."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,My concern was that those programs were designed to do exactly what they were shown to do — reward the well-connected while taxpayers and workers paid the price — rather than actually create jobs and nurture innovative new businesses.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"This is about wasted money, phantom jobs, squandered opportunities, and misplaced priorities. This is about a failed status quo and a broken system."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s time to fix it and, together, we can."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Together, where there is greed we will restore opportunity. Where there is failure we will forge success. And together, we can replace narrow thinking with common cause."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Between 2010 and 2017, $8 billion in corporate tax breaks were given away. More than $11 billion have been awarded over the past 13 years to lure companies to come to, or stay in, New Jersey. By the close of 2017 we were handing out tax breaks at a cost of more than $160,000 per job."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The Comptroller could not prove that New Jersey got back benefits anywhere near what it handed out. Based on a sample, it could not even prove that 20 percent of the jobs promised to be created or retained actually ever were — meaning money flowed from taxpayers’ pockets into a black hole."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Tax incentive programs should be about the best of what we do in government — creating good jobs by investing taxpayer dollars with integrity, and subject to real oversight. That’s the test. And, it’s the test our system spectacularly failed."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"For the past year, this administration has fought to create a New Jersey that works for everyone. This is just the latest glaring example of what we are up against — a system that has been rigged to work for a favored few."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Let me be perfectly clear on two things.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"First, I do not oppose tax incentives. Carefully crafted, properly enforced, and transparent tax incentives have a place in a successful economic program."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I am a “pro-growth” progressive, and proudly so. I am working every day to support companies and start-ups that want to grow, create jobs, and thrive in New Jersey — and that don’t need to have a “friend” on the inside. Incentives do help. But, we need to do this the right way, the smart way, and the honest way."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Second, the overwhelming majority of companies receiving a tax incentive are good actors. There are many good corporate citizens with whom we want to work, with whom I talk every day, and alongside whom we are proving that New Jersey is the right place for innovative businesses."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Businesses like Mars, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and online retailer The RealReal. These three companies are using their incentives to create more than 1,500 new jobs right here in New Jersey while retaining hundreds more. Our welcome mat is out for them and every business or entrepreneur that wants to play by the rules."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Likewise, a strong and focused EDA is crucial to our economic success. Under the new leadership of Chairman Larry Downes and CEO Tim Sullivan, the EDA is working hard to implement the forward-leading policies our economy needs to grow."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"However, the Comptroller verified one of our worst suspicions, that in the most egregious cases, past “business incentives” got turned into “crony capitalism.”"
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The audit revealed bad policy, badly run — a program more likely to have been drawn up in a smoke-filled back room than created for New Jersey’s future. It showed that New Jersey did not implement a serious, strategic plan for creating jobs. It showed a stunning lack of controls to ensure that these tax break programs lived up to their promises."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The results underscore why, while the rest of the nation was recovering from the Great Recession, we lagged in both job and wage growth."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"What attracts businesses and creates jobs is a skilled and agile workforce, working modern infrastructure, great public schools, cutting edge research colleges and universities, innovative public-private partnerships, an unmatched location, and a culture that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I have used the example of Massachusetts before. It bears repeating. No one calls Massachusetts a low-tax state. But, their economy over the past decade has run laps around us. How? It wasn’t a single-minded reliance on tax incentives — the average Massachusetts award is nearly one-eighth of what we had been giving out, $22,000 per job. They did it by investing in education and infrastructure, and building connections between higher education and the real economy."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"In essence, where we should have invested the bulk of our $11 billion."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"In the upcoming fiscal year, these tax breaks from the past will cost us more than $1 billion. To those who bemoan our inability to pay for even the most basic items in our budget, let me say that this, simply put, is nuts."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"This is taxpayer money. For the same price as these tax breaks, New Jersey could have funded our public schools, funded NJ TRANSIT, met our pension obligations, provided more property tax relief, or all of the above. We could have rebuilt the entire Portal Bridge, on our own, seven times. We could have built the ARC Tunnel, or at least financed nearly the entire length of the Gateway Tunnel."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Any of these would have actually boosted our economy and made life better for New Jerseyans.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, that, after all, is the reason we’re all here — to make life better for our residents."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Tax incentives must be just one tool in our toolbox. Education, infrastructure, workforce development — those are the primary tools for building a stronger and fairer economy and a stronger and fairer New Jersey. Tax incentives should be used strategically and sparingly to get us to our goal."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"A few tweaks to the status quo cannot, and will not, get us there."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I am calling for a new program that is capped in the amount of money it gives out, has clear eligibility criteria and oversight, has flexibility, and works to achieve our broader goals by investing in the high-wage, high-growth sectors upon which we must rebuild our economy. It is focused. It is smart. It is about fostering the new economy rather than simply helping a few big corporations."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I put forward the principles for such a program in October, when I unveiled my economic master plan — and I have shared my proposal with legislative leadership."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We need a system that rewards those who invest in their employees through skills development and training, and that cares about growing innovative and promising small and medium-sized companies. We need a program that encourages companies to invest in our communities and our Opportunity Zones."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Several of those zones — in Newark and Jersey City — have already been recognized as among the most advantageous in the entire country. They are but a few of the 169 Opportunity Zones we designated in 75 municipalities, at least one in every county."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Plainfield Mayor Adrian Mapp is already moving forward on plans to maximize his city’s three Opportunity Zones. Mayor Mapp is with us, and I share his excitement in Plainfield’s potential."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We need this more responsible and sustainable tax-incentive program to work hand-in-hand with the rest of our pro-growth agenda, and to buttress the new startup incentive programs offered by the EDA, which are now welcoming entrepreneurs to our incubators and co-working spaces."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, it will work alongside the new Evergreen Innovation Fund, our proposal for partnering with venture capital firms to help grow the next generation of innovative New Jersey companies."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Rising Tide Capital, a non-profit funder, is headed by Alfa Demmellash. Alfa and her team are supporting promising new businesses in underserved communities. Alfa had hoped to be here today, but is currently on an out-of-state business trip, seeking new partnership opportunities. I spoke with her this morning. I know the Evergreen Innovation Fund will give her more New Jersey partners to help fulfill Rising Tide’s mission."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"By the way, Alfa came to America from Ethiopia at the age of 12. She ultimately graduated from Harvard, and is now a game-changer in our state. I hope you are watching, President Trump, because her life is the American Dream."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The next transformative company is out there. We know that. With this economic master plan in place, we can increase the odds that that company will be born and bred right here in New Jersey."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The bottom line is that being competitive isn’t a race to give out the biggest tax breaks. It’s about leading the way on education, infrastructure, and diversity and inclusion. Companies want to stay and grow and locate in a state that allows them to flourish and for their workers to prosper in all parts of their lives. New Jersey has the potential to check every one of those boxes."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,That is a vision of true success that can be shared by every family. That is how you build a stronger and fairer New Jersey. I ask you now to work with me to enact a new incentive program that will help us create a new economy.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"One of my greatest privileges as governor has been getting to know the people who hired me, and for whom I work. Every day, I see the unmatched decency, character, and commitment of our people. That is why, despite these challenges, I am more optimistic than ever about our future."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The people I talk with — in diners and town halls, on walks down the Shore, in houses of worship, or riding NJ TRANSIT — never hesitate to give me a piece of their mind. Frankly, the more time I spend outside Trenton the more I learn that all the answers do not come from Trenton."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I often hear, “we need some help.” Help paying our bills ... help paying for college … help saving for the future. That is not a demand for a hand-out, it is an acknowledgement that their struggles are real and there is no shame in that."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I hear people say that the system doesn’t work for them. And, make no mistake, the unchecked corporate tax incentive program is the most glaring example."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"In these challenging times, the people of New Jersey are not wrong to be concerned. But they are far more right to be hopeful that we will level the playing field and give them their shot at success."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"That is what drives me every single day. And, it is what has led us to do many good things together."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"By any measure, working together — with Senate President Sweeney, Speaker Coughlin, and each of you — we had a productive year."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, because of that, I can proudly say that the state of our state is stronger and fairer than it was one year ago."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, more New Jerseyans are working and fewer are unemployed."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, more young children are attending a high-quality pre-K program, and many older students are starting on their way to a tuition-free Associate’s degree."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, we have more income tax fairness and more property tax relief for working families."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, the cost of health insurance is significantly down for thousands of New Jerseyans."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, Planned Parenthood is funded."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, women and their families benefit from the nation’s strongest equal-pay law. And, the rights of our LGBTQ community are further safeguarded."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, our loved ones are more secure because we passed a national model for earned sick leave."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, more of our veterans have access to medical marijuana to treat their PTSD, so they can get their lives back, and go to work or school. We thank our veterans for their service, and may God bless them all."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, companies from around the world are coming here to create good jobs in the innovation economy."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, unions — from educators to laborers — are back at the table."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, New Jersey is leading the nation in fighting climate change, from promoting clean energy alternatives to rejoining RGGI."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, our communities are safer because we have strengthened common sense gun safety laws."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today, that is what stronger and fairer looks like."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The vision of a stronger, fairer New Jersey was born from an understanding of what it’s like for families who struggle, and a commitment to helping everyone succeed."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,You may have heard me say — once or twice — that I grew up “middle class on a good day.” It is the job of each of us in this chamber to make sure that New Jersey’s families can have many more good days than bad.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I know what it is like taking out student loans and having to work to be able to afford the cost of college. I didn’t pay off my loans until I was in my thirties. Most of all, I know what it’s like when a community, a government, and our leaders have your back. And, when they work together to pull you ahead rather than push you back."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Yet, I am worried — we should all be worried — that my story, and the story of so many, seems further and further out of reach. The opportunities that could be earned by hard work, a good education, and playing by the rules are not there today as they were when I was growing up."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Today would have been the 90th birthday of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His gospel of love and sharing common ground still inspires. Dr. King famously said, “We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now.”"
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Our wealth gap shows how far we have to go. According to research from the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, the median net worth of the average white family in New Jersey stands at $271,000. For Latino families it is $7,000. And, it is just $5,900 for African-American families. That is a startling statistic we must address."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"But, the struggles of poverty and income know no color. Look no further than the 2018 ALICE study done by the United Way of Northern New Jersey — more than one-third of all New Jersey households, encompassing all ages and races, in every county, still can’t earn enough to afford basic needs. The fact that many of these households are headed by someone working full time, including at more than one job, shows us the need for action."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,The working poor of New Jersey are no longer invisible. We see them.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Their needs point to our need for a new approach that reaches deep into every community and puts growing and sustaining a thriving middle-class before anything, or anyone, else."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s really this simple — as governor, I’m fighting to give every child and every family in New Jersey the same opportunities I had growing up in a tight-knit, working-class family, and I won’t stop fighting until they do."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Those who have been left out must be lifted up. Those who work hard must have their effort repaid. And those who are doing well should see a path to doing better.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Changing this mindset has been our Administration’s charge for the past 364 days.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Overcoming these economic disparities begins by ensuring equal opportunity to a good job. Last year, from the time I took office through November 2018, our economy created 50,000 new private-sector jobs. Our unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 2001. And, we saw the creation of more than 100 new apprenticeship programs that hired more than 2,000 new apprentices and issued over 1,000 industry-recognized certificates of completion, giving more of our residents a strong start to a good career."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"To prepare our kids for a better future, we invested hundreds of millions of dollars in our schools and pre-K. Now, 4,000 more three- and four-year-olds are attending a high-quality pre-K program. And, starting this semester, 13,000 worthy students are attending community college tuition-free."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We were able to make these investments by asking those with incomes over $5 million to pay a little more, and by ensuring a more equitable distribution of school aid. We are proving that investment in our kids is also an investment in middle-class tax relief. To help our property taxpayers, we are also taking steps to promote common sense shared services."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We met our pension obligation and, working in partnership with our public employees, we reached an agreement that will save state and local taxpayers half-a-billion dollars in health care costs over two years."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"These advancements are taking some of the weight off the shoulders of our property taxpayers. In 2018, New Jersey saw the lowest increase in statewide average property taxes on record."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We know we have much more to do to crack the back of our property tax burden — including working with our federal delegation to reinstate the SALT deduction. But, it’s a start."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"While some in Washington continue their assault on our health care, we protected health care for hundreds of thousands of residents, by restoring funding for Planned Parenthood and women’s health care, enacting paid sick leave protections for 1.2 million residents who couldn’t take a day off, and safeguarding the Affordable Care Act — an effort that resulted in a more than nine percent reduction in premiums on the individual market."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We put $100 million into fighting our opioid crisis, and have dedicated these resources to better strategic use, through access to treatment and recovery, careful data compilation and analytics, and helping law enforcement keep fentanyl out of our communities."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"The stark reality is that we have far to go. Over 3,000 lives were senselessly lost last year. But we are putting ourselves in a better position to attack this epidemic head-on."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We are emerging as a global leader in offshore wind energy, where each dollar of investment will return nearly double to our economy, and where we are working to create thousands of good-paying new, union jobs. The Board of Public Utilities recently closed the first solicitation for potential partners in building an 1,100-megawatt wind farm off our coast — enough energy to power half-a-million homes and businesses."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that realizing our offshore wind-energy potential is much smarter than drilling for oil off the Jersey Shore.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We opened up our democratic process through the nation’s broadest Automatic Voter Registration law, and through reforms to our vote-by-mail law that helped fuel the highest statewide midterm voter turnout in a generation."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,We stood up for our DREAMers — young immigrants who are just as American as our four kids — by finally giving them access to in-state college tuition assistance programs.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"One of these students, Gloria Rodriguez, from Orange, is now attending Bloomfield College, where she is a member of the honors college. She’s studying to become a special education teacher. Gloria represents the promise and spirit of our DREAMers, and is with us today — I cannot wait to see her achieve her dream."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, we’re investing in NJ TRANSIT to make the system work again for the nearly one million New Jerseyans who depend upon it every day. There is still much to do, but I am committed to making NJ TRANSIT the turnaround story of New Jersey."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"When our Administration took office, passenger safety was not a priority, and work on meeting the federal government’s December 31, 2018 Positive Train Control requirement — nearly nine years after Congress mandated it — was just 12 percent complete. No one thought we would make it, but, in eleven months, we met the federal requirement."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"There is still more to be done to have this system fully operational by the end of 2020, but our commitment — and the hard work of NJ TRANSIT’s employees — sends a strong signal to commuters that we are listening to them and working hard to get things right at every level."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"This year, NJ TRANSIT’s full focus will be on improving customer communications, service, and reliability. Four classes of new rail engineers will graduate, joining newly hired bus operators. And, in my budget address six weeks from now, I will outline additional investments to continue improving NJ TRANSIT service by hiring even more engineers to fill staff shortages and get our trains running on time."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Fixing NJ TRANSIT is the right kind of business incentive.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Our focus on improving operations and instilling a customer-based mindset is changing the culture within NJ TRANSIT. And, our bipartisan reform to NJ TRANSIT’s operations is sending the message to customers that NJ TRANSIT now works for them, and not the other way around."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We’re not done yet, but we will get there."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"All of this progress was made possible through the 169 new laws we enacted together in our first year, more than any first-year administration in over two decades. In addition, I signed more than four dozen executive orders, advancing our priorities of job creation, environmental protection, equal rights, and fair pay."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I am eager to build on this progress together with Senate President Sweeney, Speaker Coughlin, and each of you. There is still much to do. And, no one is blind to the challenges that remain."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"So, let’s start 2019 by finishing what we began in 2018 — putting the minimum wage on a clear and responsible path to $15 an hour, and legalizing adult-use marijuana. We must remember that when we talk about policy we are talking about people, not politics."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,Our minimum wage workers got a 25-cent per hour increase on January 1 — a scant $10 more on a 40-hour work week. That’s completely inadequate.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Working together with the Senate President and Speaker, we have made great progress over the past several days on final legislation to raise our minimum wage. I appreciate the progress we have made and I know, working together, we will get this done."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"A $15 dollar an hour minimum wage will give more than one million families a stronger foothold in the middle class, and allow those who aspire to enter the middle class the means to do so. The people this will help are the same people all of us rely on — maintenance workers, child-care workers and home health aides, security guards, and many more."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Doing so will allow us to invest more in education, in infrastructure, and in other critical needs. A higher minimum wage strengthens all of New Jersey."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, it will also strengthen our businesses. Talk with Ron Rivers, the owner of Love2Brew, a successful homebrewing supply company in North Brunswick. Ron pays his employees a starting wage of $15 per hour because he knows better pay gets him better employees who serve the customer better."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Ron is here today, and I thank him for setting an example for others to follow."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"By legalizing adult-use marijuana — first and foremost — we can reverse the inequality and unfairness left from years of failed drug policies and shift public safety resources to where they can do the most good. We must ensure that those with a past mark on their records because of a low-level offense can have that stain removed, so they can move forward to get a stable job or an education."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"But, it will also allow us to broadly benefit from creating an entirely new and legal industry, much as we did last year with sports betting. We are learning from the states that went before us on what not to do, but we are also seeing the positive economic impacts. Massachusetts’ new industry is creating an estimated 19,000 new jobs. And, in Colorado, legalization fostered an industry that has an annual statewide economic impact measured at $2.4 billion, with 18,000 new jobs created in research, agriculture, processing, and retail."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We can do that here, and in a smart way that ensures fairness and equity for minority-owned businesses and minority communities."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Last year, we enacted seven new common-sense gun safety laws which returned us to our rightful place as a national leader. Let’s take additional steps this year to close remaining loopholes — to make it easier for prosecutors and police to keep illegal guns off our streets, regulate and track ammunition sales, and assist community-based organizations in implementing coordinated, evidence-based, violence-intervention strategies. Let’s work together to get this done."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Our collective conscience has been moved by Parkland and Pittsburgh, but we have acted because of people like Hessie Williams of Jersey City, who channeled the grief of losing her own son to gun violence to organize A Mother’s Pain, which brings together other mothers who have also lost children to gun violence for mutual support — and to support non-violence efforts in their community."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Hessie is with us today, and I ask that she stand and be recognized for all she is doing to stop the scourge of gun violence."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Let us use this year to also turn our attention to our aging water infrastructure. More than 1.5 million residents — north, central, and south, rural and urban — are currently serviced by water with elevated lead levels. We must leverage every opportunity to build a modern water infrastructure network that ensures the delivery of clean water to every child, and every family."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"We have inherited water infrastructure that is, in some places, a century old, if not older. Some of Newark’s water lines were installed in the 1880s. Mayor Ras Baraka has been on the frontlines of this, and I applaud him and his team for their work to protect Newark’s residents."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Outdated infrastructure is a national problem, and it requires a federal solution. I will continue working with our Congressional delegation to press the federal government for greater support and assistance — whether it pertains to clean water, or getting the Gateway Tunnel built."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Let’s open the doors to our democracy even wider. Let’s work together to allow residents to register to vote online and at the polls on Election Day. Let’s enact true early, in-person voting for our residents. Let’s allow 17-year olds to register and vote in our June primaries if they will turn 18 by the November general election."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Let’s restore voting rights for individuals on probation or parole, so we can further their reentry into society by allowing them to exercise the most sacred right offered by our society — the right to vote."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"And, let’s work together to allow all residents — regardless of status — to obtain a valid New Jersey driver’s license. Twelve states, as varied as Delaware and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, have already done so. All they’ve seen is an increase in the number of licensed and insured drivers, safer roads, and lower auto insurance premiums. Let’s do the same here."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"One year into our work, our vision for how to move New Jersey forward has not wavered. We have stayed true to our values and true to those we serve."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,We are who said we would be — and we did what we said we would do.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It comes down to this — you can’t have economic progress without social progress, and you can’t have social progress without economic progress. That’s where this journey is taking us — to a New Jersey that is both strong and fair."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,It’s not one or the other. It’s both. I was not sent here to continue peddling the false choices of the past. I was sent here to build a brighter future for our people and change our state for the better.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"I look forward to working with you — and with Senate President Sweeney and Speaker Coughlin and their teams and across the aisle — to build a state that leads for all the right reasons and in all the right ways. The state others point to and say, “that’s what the future looks like.”"
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s a state with an economy that isn’t content to be equal with our peers in terms of creating jobs or raising wages, but which leads the pack."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s a state where the light bulb first flickered on, the transistor age started, and medical miracles were born that now has a strategic economic vision for growth, and reclaims our mantle as the world’s home for innovation."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s a state where young people from across our nation will want to come to start their careers, where they can find good jobs, affordable housing, and diverse and inclusive communities."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,It’s a state where young families can grow and prosper.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"A state that redefines public education for our nation, with access to a free education from pre-K all the way to an Associate’s degree."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"A state where our higher education system and the real economy are connected, where good jobs can sustain middle-class dreams."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,A state where our seniors can retire safe in the knowledge that someone is looking out for them so they won’t have to leave for elsewhere.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s a state where we shrink the economic inequities that have stubbornly persisted, where poverty is meaningfully reduced, and the playing field is level."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s a state that doesn’t just provide a good value, but thrives through living its strong values."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"It’s the New Jersey we should be — the New Jersey, that together, we can be."
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”"
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,My energy and optimism for the job ahead are boundless. They are shared by the residents I have met along this journey. I know we can make this vision a reality.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,This is my charge as governor. This must be our charge as a state.
New Jersey,Phil Murphy,Democrat,"Thank you. May God continue to bless the great people and state of New Jersey, and the United States of America."""
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Thank you. Mr. Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Madam Pro Tem, honorable legislators, distinguished guests, my friends, the first Manny, my daughter Erin, my granddaughter Avery, Avery’s other grandmother Sandy Reiger, my sister-in-law, the Honorable Sandra Grisham, my brother Gregory Lujan, everybody who isn’t watching the impeachment trial on C-SPAN, and my fellow New Mexicans:"
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"This past year I heard from many members of our extended New Mexico family. Students wrote letters. Parents came to my office. I met advocates and entrepreneurs as we traveled across the state -- from Carlsbad and Silver City to the Navajo Nation and beyond. New faces and old friends. Police officers, veterans, educators and business-owners. Over and over, I heard two things."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"One: Do you really drink that much coffee? No comment -- but also, yes."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Second, time and again, New Mexicans told me: Keep going."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"The state of our state is dynamic, ready for more, on the cusp of steady and sustainable progress. We are stronger today than we were one year ago -- no question. Fifteen-thousand new jobs in New Mexico since the day I took office, the best year for job growth in the state since 2005. Our economy is booming in every direction: Long-time New Mexico businesses are boosting their investments in our state. Exciting new companies are putting down roots here for the first time, choosing to be in the Land of Enchantment. We are top ten nationally for inbound moves, a complete reversal from only a few years ago, when families were leaving our state -- and one third of the people moving to New Mexico are coming here for jobs."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Since the day I took office, we are #8 nationally for job growth. I like the sound of top 10, and I like the sound of this even better: Our private-sector job growth is beating Nevada, California and Colorado. As I said a hundred times this year, in every community I visited across our state: New Mexico is the place to be, and if you’re not here, you better get here fast."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"At the close of Year One, at the outset of Year Two, state government is stronger and gathering strength. Our December statewide rapid-hire events drew 3,700 job-seekers – that’s 3,700 New Mexicans eager for work, eager to serve their communities and neighbors right now. Together we delivered meaningful raises for New Mexico educators passionate about their students. We launched pivotal transformations in environmental leadership and in long-overdue infrastructure. Our Children, Youth and Families Department this year cut the average wait time on its Child Abuse Hotline from an unconscionable hour-plus to less than five minutes. Our Human Services Department settled with each of the behavioral health providers ejected from the state by the Martinez administration, a monumental step toward the robust and rebuilt behavioral health system New Mexico urgently needs. Our Workforce Solutions Department has gone after wage theft, standing up for workers against bad actors who are violating the law and taking advantage of them. Our Corrections Department successfully took over management of the private prison in Clayton, overseeing a safe and seamless transition into better administration. We settled the Jackson and Duran litigations, ending cases that have lasted decades and cost the state tens of millions of dollars. We took the initiative on building up our state’s reserves for a future rainy day. We made sure we have an equitable framework for reforming our state pension system in a way that protects New Mexico taxpayers and respects retirees, both current and future. We boosted common-sense oversight of polluters; and we put New Mexico on a direct path to being the nation’s clean energy leader, ensuring our land, air and water -- our inheritance as residents of this incredible state -- are passed on to future generations. We brought industry and environmental leaders together, and we are moving forward on creating nation-leading rules that will curb methane pollution, create jobs and deliver more dollars into New Mexico classrooms. We took on the Trump administration when they abandoned border communities, when they tried to gain access to our workforce data so they could deport working parents and tear families apart. With your help, we will keep up those efforts, those good fights -- and we will keep investing for a bright tomorrow while delivering solutions to the urgent needs of today."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,We are fixing what was left broken and addressing urgent needs and turning the corner into the bright future of our incredible state -- all at once.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Year One: I’d call it a very, very good start. Thank you, honorable legislators, even Debbie Armstrong -- thank you all for your support and leadership in helping us capitalize on the incredible opportunity of this moment."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"But, as you know, we’ve still got a lot of work to do. For one thing: We still haven’t shortened all these podiums, they’re too tall! That was the first thing I said we had to do!"
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"In all seriousness: We accomplished so very much in one year, and yet the economic growth we’ve seen has not touched families in every part of the state. We have not yet completed the diversification and expansion efforts we must undertake to ensure New Mexico’s prosperity is durable and meaningful. The educational transformation that’s begun to take shape is still in the first few innings. So, no, I did not hear New Mexicans telling me, “great, job done” -- I heard them say, “great, keep going.”"
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"And we are building something substantial and sweeping and powerful -- for the generations to come and for New Mexicans right now. We are investing for tomorrow and delivering today. We must continue to do both -- aggressively, strategically, with fiscal responsibility top of mind."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"In equal measure, I am proud of the distance we have covered, eager for the chance to do more right now, and perfectly aware of the climb we still have to make."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"As we open this 30-day session, I challenge you to think beyond the 30 days. Think beyond even this year. We stand together in the sunrise of a new decade. What we do here in this session, in this coming year, will set the course for what comes over the horizon in 2030 and beyond. The progress begins right here in this room and on the other side of the building -- the accomplishments of lawmakers present and past, including those beloved friends and colleagues we lost this year, Representative Bill Pratt, Senator Carlos Cisneros, Senator John Pinto. It’s important to reflect on their many contributions to our state and what each of them, in their own way, delivered for their constituents and all of New Mexico. If we can take a quiet moment to remember them:"
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Thank you. Over this next year and in this coming decade, how will we work together to make New Mexico the state of success? The power to answer the call forcefully is in our hands, in our willingness and capacity to be relentless and bold, right now."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"We begin where we must: Education. It would be inaccurate to say we chose education as our top priority. Transforming our public education ecosystem is no less than a moral mandate, an imperative that found us, this group of legislative leaders who are obligated and, I believe, destined to deliver the single best cradle-to-career educational system in the country."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"I insist, alongside every devoted parent and dedicated advocate in the state, that we get it right, right now. And at the same time I recognize that what we are building requires long-term vision. We all must recognize that a genuine transformation, a moonshot, doesn’t occur overnight. But our goal is and will continue to be meaningful positive outcomes for students and teachers all while the permanent turnaround rounds into shape."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"So we must continue to build. We’ve got to invest and deliver. We’ve got to pay educators more and we’ve got to hire more educators. And we are on our way: In Year One, we cut the statewide teacher vacancy rate by 13 percent – proof positive that the message has been received: After 8 years of neglect and disrespect, New Mexico values and supports its world-class educators once again. And we will keep going in a way that’s sustainable and real. We will, together, deliver another raise for educators and school personnel this year, the most significant back-to-back raises educators have received in almost 15 years. In our first two years, we will have provided a 10 percent across-the-board raise for our educators -- as compared to only 6% total over the eight years before that. Once again: Education was not a priority then. It is now."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"And we will keep going; we will stay the course with new programs that require a sustained focus, like extended learning time and K-5 Plus. Let’s think about what those programs represent: More meaningful time in the classroom for our at-risk students, more time for them to learn, create and build relationships. And we know there’s a direct line between that and higher achievement. With the Public Education Department working alongside districts around the state, we estimate, next year, more than half of New Mexico’s K-12 student body taking part in extended learning programs; we estimate almost 5,000 teachers participating in K-5 Plus – teachers in the top tier taking home almost $70,000 a year."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"And we will, this year, expand our axis of emphasis to include early childhood education and care, comprehensively changing the trajectory for the youngest kids in this state, forever."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Child care, pre-k, home visiting, family nutrition, early intervention services and more – we will connect New Mexico parents with the high-quality services they need to help them both cut costs in their home budgets and provide the best possible head start for their children."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"With your support, last year, we launched the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, a monument to our belief in what our kids and families can achieve. With that new department, together, we opened the door to a new day for early childhood outcomes in New Mexico."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,We must now walk through that door and invest in learning opportunities and care networks that will make a difference for New Mexico children and families.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"We all want better outcomes for our kids and families -- but it seems we sometimes hesitate when it comes time to really provide for their future. We have the opportunity this year to do that. With the Early Childhood Trust Fund, we can establish a positive, dynamic and self-fulfilling cycle of improved outcomes for our children and families. The seeds we sow in early childhood investment right now, this year, will sustain generations to come."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,We have committed to transforming the lives and opportunities of New Mexico children and families; we believe in the unequivocal data that show the pathway begins at the earliest age; we accept that every unacceptable statistic about New Mexico’s education system stems from a lack of comprehensive opportunity for our earliest learners … so this is the moment to step up. This is the moment to stand and be counted as part of the single most comprehensive effort to transform early childhood outcomes of any state in the country.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"As long as we’re talking about leading the nation: New Mexico was the first to guarantee higher education for all. We were the first state to provide college tuition for residents. The Lottery Scholarship was ahead of its time; now, we as a state have fallen behind. We have back-slid into an environment where college-age students in New Mexico wonder not where they’ll attend college but whether they will at all, where adults who want to go back to school face a financial roadblock to new skills and fulfilling new careers. And we know we’re selling these New Mexicans short -- maybe not as short as me, but pretty dang short. We know if young adults don’t find opportunity here, they will look elsewhere."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"But if we build it, they will stay. This year, we can round out our world-class cradle-to-career educational philosophy with a comprehensive embrace of universal higher education: The Opportunity Scholarship. It is a prudent, sustainable investment in the bridge we must build between our classrooms and our workforce. We have the power to make tuition-free higher education a reality, benefiting an astounding 55,000 New Mexico students this fall. Students want it; parents want it; let’s give them the opportunity. An opportunity that works for Estevan, studying education at the Santa Fe Community College. I want Estevan to be a teacher right here in New Mexico. An opportunity that works for Yawana, a sophomore nursing student at UNM. I want Yawana to be a nurse right here in this state, where we need her. An opportunity that works for Michelle, a senior at New Mexico Tech double-majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics. I want Michelle to put those degrees to work and build her career right here in New Mexico."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"We should all want students like Estevan and Yawana and Michelle -- and the many, many talented young adults in the gallery right now and watching at home -- to find their passion here, to build their careers here, in New Mexico. And I want them to know they can do it without debt hanging over them for years. We should all be doing everything we can to make student tuition debt a thing of the past. Otherwise, we’re limiting what our young adults can do and who they can become. I would much rather invest in unlocking their unlimited potential. I’m confident we will."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"And confidence breeds confidence. Every part of this touches every other. When we move aggressively to increase wages, invest in our public education system and think outside the box about what our state economy and workforce can be, jobs and careers will follow. These students will stay and work here. We are transforming New Mexico into a place workers and growing businesses want to be. A place with stable, fulfilling employment, with opportunities to grow and raise a family."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"We are rapidly climbing out of the lost decade of job growth, the stagnation and forced austerity of the last administration. The minimum wage is on the way up for the first time in more than a decade, benefiting 100,000 New Mexico workers. We set a record for film and television shoots, 94 productions pumping nearly $600 million into our economy – with more productions in rural communities under our new rural production incentive. My Economic Development Department is making record investments in homegrown businesses all across the state -- creating more jobs and creating better-paying jobs. And I mean all across the state: I’m talking about C4 Farms, a 4th generation ranch in Rio Arriba County, where our state contribution will help them develop a processing plant and butcher shop that will serve hunters who currently take their game to Colorado. I’m talking about 420 Valley, a manufacturing start-up in Las Cruces that extracts CBD oil from hemp plants and will expand to almost 60 employees over the next 3 years. I’m talking about Duane Kinsley, the founder of Sport Systems, an Albuquerque outdoor equipment store. Duane has launched Best Deal Retailer, a start-up enterprise that has developed technology to help brick-and-mortar New Mexico retailers keep their local shoppers by beating giant online retailers. Duane is here today – thank you Duane for believing in and representing the power of local economic development, hiring New Mexicans and helping New Mexico businesses compete."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"As outlined in my budget proposal, we will build on the record Local Economic Development and Job Training Incentive funding we delivered throughout New Mexico in Year One. Thank you for your support for these essential programs: The local jobs we created last year paid 20% better than over the last 8 years. Manufacturing jobs, IT jobs, engineering and tourism and outdoor recreation jobs -- we’re creating pathways into these careers; we’re getting New Mexicans the skills they need to succeed."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Because we all want an economy that is stronger than one industry -- no matter how strong that industry is today. We’ve got to create more opportunity in rural communities, on main streets all through our state -- and so we’ve got to consider every single good idea. A perfect example is cannabis."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"This is the fact: Recreational cannabis can be the next frontier of our economic expansion. We can get in on the ground floor or we can try to play catch up -- I know which one I prefer. And I know which one New Mexicans prefer: 75 percent of New Mexico supports the legalization of adult-use cannabis, including strong support in rural areas."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"For years now, the Legislature has heard and debated recreational cannabis proposals; we’ve watched states come before us, we’ve watched them stumble in some areas, thrive in others … and every year we’ve said, “No, not yet, it’s not for us.” Well, it’s easy to get to “no.” It’s harder to stand up and create something good and new. And we’re ready for that. These 30 days are the final stages, not the starting point. My legalization working group – a team of experts and advocates, experienced stakeholders from every corner of the industry, law enforcement from rural and urban areas alike and more – built upon the conversations the Legislature has had in past years. They visited communities all across the state last year. They solicited candid community input from parents and providers and coaches and police officers; they laid out a vision of a New Mexico where we use every tool in our economic toolbelt, strategically adopting best practices from the states that have come before us, creating a thriving and safe new industry employing thousands of New Mexicans and delivering hundreds of millions in revenue back to cities and counties and the state for public safety and health care. Three of every four New Mexicans wants to realize the awesome economic potential of this industry, and I agree with the overwhelming majority of our state: I say we ought to give them the chance. It’s high time we stopped holding ourselves and our economy back: Let’s get it done this year and give New Mexicans yet another reason, yet another opportunity, to stay here and work and build a fulfilling 21st century career."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Progress is not preordained. We have to have the vision to identify productive next steps while keeping an eye on the longer path, the distances farther ahead. This past year we stood up to protect New Mexicans from pernicious federal efforts to dismantle health care services. With your support, we enacted safeguards against attempts to roll back the Affordable Care Act and strip New Mexicans of the health care lifelines they depend on. But unfortunately that’s not enough. We, as a state, have to keep fighting to ensure health care as affordable, high-quality and accessible as it can possibly be. And this year, with your support, we can move aggressively to reduce health care costs -- including drug costs -- for New Mexico families. With your support for Senate Bill 1, the state will pursue the importation of wholesale prescription drugs from Canada, cutting costs for New Mexico families. And we will begin to cap co-pays and out-of-pocket costs for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and COPD. With your support, we can invest in the essential work of rebuilding a robust behavioral health network, providing a lifeline to New Mexico families that have been devastated by drugs, violence, poverty and more. Those are investments in independence, in personal freedom, in people’s capacity to help themselves."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"New Mexico seniors deserve that chance, too. Every single senior wants to be independent and self-sufficient as long as possible. Right now, my mother Sonja is in a primary care clinic, without my brother and me, being treated for an infection that threatens hospitalization. My mother is a strong and stubborn woman -- and she’s going it alone so my brother and I can be here with you today. I remember when my father was dying -- and in spite of my mother’s strong independence, she, in fact, relied heavily on my father. After his death, my mother and I both knew she really couldn’t live alone. We began the painful effort of moving her into my home with me. And I remember taking the last box of her personal belongings and loading them into my car. What I had in that small box was the last vestige of my mother’s independence, and the only life she had really ever known. I vowed then -- and I do again today -- to restore for seniors and disabled adults and their caregivers the respect, the services and the dignity that they deserve."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,The Kiki Saavedra Senior Dignity Fund that I have proposed is designed to do just that -- to provide for the dignity and support seniors and caregivers need.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"Kiki Saavedra understood the necessity of getting that right. I remember him telling me, before every one of my appropriation requests for senior citizens would go before his committee, “Michelle, if you really care about funding these services for seniors, do not bring a thousand senior citizens into this hearing room. We don’t have time. I’ve got other committees. Do not do it.” So, I did it, and he would give me that look -- like, “You were my hita, I don’t know what you are to me now.” But you know what? He’d be there. He’d stay until every single person was heard. He’d walk around the room, he’d ask who drove the farthest, who had the oldest car -- he would make the effort to give every single person in that room the time and care and attention they deserved."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,The Kiki Saavedra Senior Dignity Fund is an investment in our capacity to provide that kind of respect. Kiki Saavedra understood that we are judged not by our personal success but what we do for others. In this session we can deliver for New Mexico seniors and make this game-changing fund a reality.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"But as we worked last year to improve the health and welfare of New Mexicans, others were working to deprive them of both. I’m talking about the criminal violence that is far too prevalent in our great state.  Let’s all agree that the days of hardened, violent, repeat offenders not doing any real time, getting unwarranted second and third and fourth chances because our system is too broken to hold people accountable … those days must end and they must end now. We have to draw a line. New Mexicans are sick and tired of seeing predators circle in and out of custody, never facing the full force of the law. I am too. Here’s the fact: Dangerous, repeat offenders have got to be in jail. If you are terrorizing our communities again and again, we have nothing to talk about: You must be stopped and held accountable."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"We have a chance in this session to come together as a state and put together the best practices, to be smart and tough on crime. Everybody – every policymaker, at every level of government – has to be on board. This year we launched, as a state, the Fugitive Apprehension Unit; we sent state police officers to help support local police efforts in Albuquerque, in Valencia County, in Alamogordo and down on the border. And under my budget proposal we will fund 60 new State Police officers and better pay for new recruits. We’ll give them the time and support they need to make meaningful connections with the communities they serve all across New Mexico -- and to keep them safe."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,I’m also proposing stiffer penalties for gun- and drug- and human-trafficking to keep the purveyors of those particular kinds of evil off our streets longer.
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"One of my staff members had to leave work early one day this fall to pick up her daughter, who was deeply shaken after her school was placed on lockdown following a threat of mass violence. Think of all our children, our friends and neighbors whose lives and livelihoods have been disrupted by lockdowns or evacuations. That’s criminal, and this session, we’re going after people who terrorize New Mexicans with threats of mass violence. "
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"If we are clear about keeping New Mexico families safe, we have to commit to accepting responsibility and giving law enforcement the tools they need -- to give New Mexicans the peace of mind they deserve. We have to create public safety, consciously and proactively and persistently, every day. Together, beginning this session, we will win this fight, and justice will be done in New Mexico."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"In these next 30 days, I will be who you know me to be. Relentless. Competitive. Caffeinated. I will be tireless on behalf of the New Mexicans who have not yet felt the effect of our changing fortunes, our push toward steady and sustainable progress. New Mexicans like Tiffanie Collins, a single mother in Grants. Her daughter turns 12 next month. Tiffanie works two jobs to provide for her daughter -- and it’s just barely enough. She feels the strain every day -- working extra time, relying on family to help care for her daughter. Tiffanie went to UNM to obtain her bachelor’s and dropped out after a few semesters because she couldn’t afford tuition. What she wants is opportunity to get ahead where she lives, in Grants, a chance to thrive and make a better life right there, a chance to get her daughter into high-quality after-school programming and get gainful, fulfilling employment so she doesn’t have to worry about the next bill, and the next bill, and the unexpected bill, maybe a medical expense, that puts everything over the edge. Tiffanie made the sacrifice to take time out of her schedule to be here today, and I want to recognize her as the kind of New Mexican who is doing absolutely everything right -- working hard, being a good mom, getting into a program where she’s learning coding skills, trying to get the kind of education and training that will help her provide for her family. We have got to make sure Tiffanie’s efforts are supported by our efforts. We’ve got to make school more affordable; we’ve got to provide jobs right where she is, not 100 miles or a couple states away; we’ve got to invest in our educators and improve our schools so she can sleep at night knowing her daughter has the best possible chance to succeed. Tiffanie’s here today because she believes in us -- and also to tell us to keep going. Because we have to do better, all of us, so New Mexicans like Tiffanie are never left behind."
New Mexico,Michelle Lujan Grisham,Democrat,"I urge you to join me in sustaining the investments we have made in the future that New Mexico families, students and workers deserve. I invite you to join me in bringing into reality the bright vision of the best possible New Mexico of 2020, 2030, 2040, a future where our youngest get the best possible head start, where students and educators have every reason to stay here and build their lives, where small businesses can thrive with a strong and dynamic workforce at the ready, where our economy includes everyone and every good idea, where New Mexicans live and thrive in safety. Together, we will keep investing for tomorrow and delivering today. We will keep going. Forward, every day, together. Thank you, and let’s get to work."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Happy New Year. This is going to be a great one, isn't it? It sure is."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"First, let's give our great Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul a big round of applause. She is a superstar. We have our great Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. 32 years of public service and he's only 36 years old. Tom DiNapoli, thank you very much."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have our new and exciting and history-making Attorney General Tish James. Pleasure to be with you. General James. General James. I like to salute. I feel as a former Attorney General, I like to salute. It's our own little Attorney general club."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have, speaking of history making, the first female Leader of the Senate, the first African American Leader of the state Senate, our Leader of our democratic Senate, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins. And let me ask all the members of the democratic senate to stand up so we can give you a round of applause. Stand up!"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Thank you. thank you. thank you. welcome. The New York State Assembly for many, many years was the progressive champion in the state of New York. For many years, when it was hard, when we had a republican conservative leadership trying to push the state backwards, it's the New York State Assembly that stood up and has always shown the way and they've shown the way again. I believe they're the most progressive, advanced legislative body in the United States of America. Let's give them a round of applause and their leader, Speaker Heastie. Stand up, Speaker Heastie."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"A great senator, a good friend, Senate Deputy Leader Joe Griffo is with us today. Stand Joe, please. Thank you very much. We have Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb, thank you very much for being with us. Will you stand please, Brian?"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And we have the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Janet DiFiore. Pleasure to be with you, Chief Judge. Please stand, be recognized. Thank you."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And point of personal privilege, but this is a combination of the Budget and the State of the State, I want to thank my team, headed by Melissa DeRosa; Rob Mujica, Budget Director; Alphonso David, Counsel; and Dr. Jim Malatras, policy guru. Let's give them a round of applause."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Today started with a number of bangs. One of them you may not have seen because nothing is ever easy. We built the new Tappan Zee bridge next to the old Tappan Zee Bridge. The old Tappan Zee Bridge became structurally unstable and they literally couldn't remove it because they were afraid of the instability of the structure. So the contractor who owns the bridge went through a number of options and came up with the best option was felling the bridge. They call it accelerated felling. It means blowing up the bridge, but they like to say accelerated felling, so whatever they want to call it. The danger of the situation, as you can see, it's very close to the new bridge. So that happened this morning and it happened like this—"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"If that did not go right, talk about blowing a hole in the budget. That would have really done it. So we're off with a bang and we have a lot to do and a lot of good news, so let me run through it for you and thank you for providing me the opportunity and I thank the people of the state of New York for, once again, providing me the opportunity to serve as their Governor."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"This year, we think it's the year to fully enact a justice agenda, in the broadest sense of the word justice. Social justice, economic justice, and racial justice. And that this is the time to do it. We face real challenges in the state of New York. We have a federal government that is assaulting our values, our liberties, our rights, and our economy. Literally our economy. The federal cuts to our budget would be devastating and the federal effect on the values and liberties on New Yorkers would be devastating. And this is the moment in government that we are leading. And it is up to us to bring this state forward. We have no allies who are going to help us. The federal government is not going to help us. It's up to this legislative body to lead this state at this crucial time."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The good news is, as you heard from the Lieutenant Governor, the state has already made great progress. We've turned around basic trajectories. It is a functional government. It is competent. We are accomplishment oriented. We're the most progressive government in the United States of America. We balanced budgets. We have the most socially progressive accomplishments of any state in the nation and it's not even close. First big state to pass Marriage Equality. First state to pass $15—the highest minimum wage. The most aggressive building agenda in the state. A national champion for organized labor, which is under attack by this administration and has a friend in the state of New York. The nation leading environmental agenda. The first free college tuition program. That's New York. The best Paid Family Leave program in the nation and a leader on gun safety. That's the state of New York and that's what you've done."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"But, what's even more remarkable, is we match that agenda for social progress with economic progress. Today, the state has 8.2 million private sector jobs. You know how many jobs that is? That is the highest number of jobs the state has ever had in its history. That's how many jobs that is. Statewide unemployment rate was 8.4 percent when we started. It is now down to 3.9 percent today. You know how low that is? It is the lowest level in recorded history for unemployment. That's something to be proud of. And the economic success is not in one part of the state as it has been in many years past. The growth has been all across the state of New York. From the North Country all through the state we're seeing our efforts bring uniform economic progress. And a big part of it is the building that we have been doing. The building of the economy and the vision that we have had in terms of economic development. And not just talking about it, but actually doing it. Actually making it happen. And the record of what we have built and done is staggering. Starting in buffalo with the Peace Bridge/Gateway project—$57 million, which has been done. New Rochester Airport, which has been finished; new Elmira Corning Airport, which is up and running; new Syracuse Airport, which is up and running; Plattsburgh Airport; the new Schenectady Train Station, which is done; the State Fair Transformation—$120 million—it's done. Just broke a new attendance record, over one million fairgoers coming to Central New York to go to the fair. New Expo Center at the fairgrounds, one of the largest in the northeast. We have the National Comedy Center that just broke ground. It just opened up about five months ago. Already you have visitors from 49 states going to Jamestown, New York to our Comedy Center. Isn't that amazing? This Friday and Saturday night, Howard Zemsky will be appearing at the Comedy Center. And tickets will be on sale immediately after this presentation."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The Binghamton Pharmacy School is a reality. We got that done. The Queens Midtown Tunnel is finished. The Brooklyn Battery Tunnel is finished. Gore, Whiteface, Belleayre, Ski Mountain Resorts have been transformed. That's done, bringing more tourism up to the North Country. The Long Island artificial reefs, the largest ever. It helps the ecosystem, fishing diving industry. That has been done. The Mario Cuomo Bridge, as you just saw, has been done."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"New Ithaca Airport is going to open this year. This year, a new thoroughfare, new transfer station at the Woodbury Road and transit hub, which will greatly alleviate traffic in that entire area. We are going to finish the Kosciuszko Bridge and it's going to happen this year—the second span, ending that traffic nightmare. The Shirley Chisholm State Park on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn. The largest State Park in New York City."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And it will be open this year. We have more underway. The Albany Airport is being totally transfigured. We will be able to get there faster and easier. The new Moynihan Train Hall, which will replace the need to have to go into Penn Station, which is going to be a state-of-the-art facility opens in 2020. We have a new Long Island Rail Road entrance going in on 33rd Street in Manhattan. The Jones Beach revitalization, which is bringing it back to the majesty of Robert Moses. That opens in 2020. Letchworth State Park renovations voted the number one state park in the nation, believe it or not. It is magnificent and it is going to be more magnificent."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The Empire Trail, which is the largest recreational trail in the United States, will be finished in 2020. A new LaGuardia Airport, which is already being open now. It's going to be finished in 2021. New JFK Airport, which is going to be opening in 2025. The Bronx is getting four new Metro North stations going into Penn Station. Long Island, after 70 years of talking about expanding the Long Island Rail Road, we are putting in second track and a third track and 100 projects along that way to transform the Long Island Rail Road. That's underway. We are ahead of schedule. The second track is completed this year. The third track will be in 2022."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The cashless tolling is in place downstate. It's going to be statewide in 2020 with doubling the size of the Javits Convention Center because it opened in 1984. At one time it was the most competitive in the nation. It became literally outsized. We're doubling it and it's going to open in 2021. We have Roc the Riverway in Rochester with Lovely Warren, which is a whole revitalization along the water. Don't make Lovely clap alone. Everybody clap."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,And we are going to be the first state to have high speed broadband 100 percent all across the state.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We did all of this work and all of this investment and we have unprecedented fiscal integrity. State debt is down and our credit ratings are the highest levels since 1972. Because we managed government better, we were able to lower taxes, which are now at historic lows. Lowest middle class tax rate since 1947. Even I wasn't born in 1947. Lowest manufacturers tax since 1917. Lowest corporate tax since 1968. So, a great record of accomplishment. A lot of momentum. But I really believe you ain't see nothing yet because I believe what we're going to get done in this legislative session is going to make history in the state of New York. And is going to make history in the nation.  We have great leadership."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have great leadership in the democratic Assembly. As I mentioned, it has been the progressive legislative body in the nation. We have a great progressive leader. This is the closest picture we could find of a smile for the speaker."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Let's give him another round of applause, Speaker Carl Heastie. And this year we have a new partner. We have historic leadership and we have a Democratic Senate. And we do have much to do together. The federal government is trying to roll back the Affordable Health Care Act. It has dire repercussions for this state. We want to protect affordable health care. We need to codify the ACA and safeguard the protections for preexisting conditions in our law so the federal government cannot change those protections, period."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,I believe we should pass a constitutional amendment. Not just a Roe v. Wade law. A constitutional amendment. Let's write the rights of Roe v. Wade into the state constitution so it can never be changed. No matter what happens politically. And pass the Reproductive Health Act and the Contraceptive Care Act. We need to reform our criminal justice system by eliminating cash bail once and for all. And enacting speedy trial. And discovery reform. Pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Let's standup. Let's do it. Let's lead the way.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Let's pass a democracy agenda. Talk about voter disenfranchisement—why do the polls open at noon in a primary in upstate New York but 6 a.m. in Downstate New York? Let's give every person the right to vote. Make it easy to vote. If we want people to vote, why not make Election Day a holiday and give them the time to come out and actually vote?"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We passed the SAFE Act. Today this is the anniversary of the SAFE Act. At that time people said to us, 'oh you don't need gun laws. The Sandy Hook Massacre was a once in a lifetime.' Which had just happened. We were right and they were wrong. And history proved us right. We have more mass shootings, more gun violence, more student deaths. New York led the way. Let New York lead the way again and pass the Red Flag Law. Ban bump stocks, extend the waiting period from three days to 10 days."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,Pass the Child Victims Act. It has been too long. This is the year we need to do it. Pass the Dream Act. It has been too long. This is the year we need to do it. Pass the Dream Act. It's been too long. Dreams deferred are dreams denied. We are going to pass it this year.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,Legalize adult-used cannabis. Stop the disproportionate criminal impact on communities of color. And let's create an industry that empowers the poor communities that pay the price and not the rich corporations who come in to make a profit.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,Implement real campaign finance reform. Close the LLC loophole. Ban corporate campaign contributions. Let's overhaul the campaign financing system. Let's pass campaign finance and let's reform independent expenditures because the abuse is outrageous.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"It is our generational obligation to make sure we leave this place better than we found it. We need to invest in clean, safe drinking water. We have a $2.5 billion investment to replace infrastructure all across the state, and let's launce the next phase of the Green New Deal mandating 100 percent power by 2040, the fastest in the United States of America, and lead the way, and lead the way to eliminating our carbon footprint. We know the future. Let New York lead."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,We invested in upstate casinos. Let's authorize sports betting in the upstate casinos. It's here. It's a reality and it will help generate activity in those casinos.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,And let's enact the most aggressive the most aggressive pro-labor protection agenda in the United States of America.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Our middle-class are the ones who are suffering. Our middle-class are the ones who took it on the chin. Let's protect our progressive tax code, and let's cut taxes for the middle-class so they know we're on their side and let's do it this year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,Let's provide and protect more affordable housing by finally enacting aggressive rent-regulation reform. With the democratic senate we can get that done.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,And let's continue our Build New York program which is the most aggressive in the United States and invest another $150 billion in rebuilding our infrastructure and our transit system.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,And let's overhaul the MTA and pass congestion pricing so we have reliable funding stream for the MTA once and for all.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"It's a lot. No doubt about it. But there's been a lot that has been bottled up for many, many years that we couldn't get done. And in many ways I feel the state is now liberated with the senate democratic caucus and we can get these things done and we can get them done together and pass a new budget and I believe we can get them done within the first 100 days to show this state a new reality."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Now on the finances for the state, we start with the $3 billion hole, largely because of the federal policies. The revenues have slowed. We believe it's attributed to the federal SALT program which we all predicted was going to have a dramatic effect on New York. What the federal government did with SALT, was it penalized New York more than it did any other state. New York State is the number one donor state in the United States of America. We send more money to Washington than we get back, and we send more money that we don't get back than any other state in the nation. 40 states take more than they give. So, we have a federal government that is against redistribution of income among people, but they have no problem redistributing income from some states to other states and what they did is they took from the republican democratic states to give to the republican states and we're feeling the pain. And that's a $3 billion hole. At the same time, we have priority investments we want to make. So we have a negative $3 billion and we want to invest more in targeted priorities and this budget tries to balance them."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The four largest cost priorities are education, health care, MTA, infrastructure and a middle-class tax cut. On education, we should be very proud of the money we spend. We spend the most money per pupil in the nation. We spend two times the national average. The problem with our education system is the inequity in the funding and the differential in funding between rich schools and poor schools. This has been a topic we have been talking about for 30 or 40 years. And we've been talking around and around and around and in truth, my friends, we have missed the mark and we haven't accomplished the goal. The assumption we had, was if we fund the poorer school districts, they would turn around the poorer schools in their districts. That was our assumption. It was a bad assumption."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"New York State provides 70 percent of its funding to the poorer districts. 70 percent to the poorer districts. We believed that meant we were funding the poorer schools. Well, you weren't. You were funding the poorer districts. And then, the districts turned around and decided how to distribute the funds. And they did not distribute the funds to the poorer schools. That assumption was flawed. Last year, to your credit, we demanded school-level transparency on 76 major districts representing half of all the students in the state. We're increasing it this year. The findings are worrisome. We gave 70 percent of the funding to the poorer districts but it never found its way to the poorer schools."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"City of Buffalo, for example, poorer school -- $15,000, wealthier school - $17,000. Rochester - poorer schools, we're spending about $18,000 per student, $26,000 in the wealthier school district. Syracuse, 18 and 22. New York City, 21 and $26,000 in the wealthier school districts. Yonkers, 17,000 and 21,000 in the wealthier school districts. I believe the exact opposite is what should be happening. The needs in the poorer school districts and the poorer schools are greater. I spent my whole life working in low-income communities working with the homeless. Those children have more obstacles than the children in the richer schools. It's the child who's going home to a New York City public housing project and whose mother is working or whose father is working and is going home alone, that student needs more help than the student who is going home to a two-parent household where they're getting tutored. The additional resources, the additional need has to go to the poorer school, and the poorer student. That's education equity. And that's what we've been talking about for 40 years and we haven't achieved it. Let's stop talking and let's start doing, and let's actually have a law that accomplishes what we want to accomplish. We want to make sure that this state can say a quality education regardless of income, race, or zip code and that's how our funds should be distributed."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"This budget raises the total education budget to $27 billion but it introduces a new formula called the Education Equity Formula which would distribute the money not just to the poorer districts, but to the poorer schools in the poorer districts. And let's end those funding disparities once and for all. The breakdown of the education funding you see—expanding Pre-K afterschool, an early childhood, master teacher program in community schools. Higher education, we're providing $7.6 billion for higher education. It's a $1.6 billion, or 27 percent increase, since 2012. Our Excelsior Scholarship Free Tuition Program, no program like it in the nation. It says to every student, every child tonight who puts his or her head on the pillow, I don't care if your mother or father can pay for college. If you can get in, you're going because there's free tuition to state schools and we're raising that threshold today, this year, to $125,000 family threshold so the middle class families. What we call the middle class, at $125,000 don't have to worry about how they're going to pay for their kids' tuition because the state will pay for their tuition to a SUNY or a CUNY school. Today, 55 percent of all SUNY and CUNY students are going to tuition free, and you should feel good about that."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We talked about education. The second need is healthcare and I think they go hand in glove. Everyone needs education, everyone needs healthcare. We are under attack by the Federal Government, especially when it comes to healthcare. We're looking at about $2.5 billion dollars in what they call DSH cuts, which are to distressed hospitals. About a $1 billion loss in cost-sharing. Medicaid cuts have been proposed, have been threatened, we don't know what they're going to be. And we have on top of that, the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, including promoting plans that don't really cover pre-existing conditions. We need to fund education and we need to fund healthcare. If you look at what we've done over the past years, the healthcare funding has been about at the inflation rate. Education funding has been over the education inflation rate. Over the past years, since I've been here, we've actually put $13.6 billion more into education than its inflation index rate, and healthcare has been about flat. This year I propose 3.6% increase to both healthcare and education. It will give the healthcare industry the help they need to stabilize while we fight off these federal cuts in the meantime which are, long-term, unsustainable for us."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"On the MTA and infrastructure, we need to fund NYCTA, which is the New York City Transit Authority, Long Island Rail Road, Metro North and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. And continue building our program in the rest of the state, downstate and upstate. I don't know why only one person would clap for that. I say to my team all the time. It's M&M's, not the candy. It's always about management, and then it's about the money. When it comes to the MTA, we have a system that was designed in the 1960s that nobody would design today. The MTA has 17 members on the board, six are appointed by the state, four by New York City, seven by the counties. If the board ever manages to pass anything, the Governor then has a unilateral veto over the capital budget, with no override. It'd be great if I could have that in Albany. You veto it, and there's no override. The Mayor of the City of New York has a unilateral veto over the capital plan. The Speaker of the Assembly, unilateral veto. The Senate Leader, unilateral veto. So it is an unmanageable process. When everyone is in charge, no one is in charge."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Was it a dumb idea when they set it up? No. Was it diabolical? Very. It was purposefully designed so that everyone can point fingers at everybody else, and nobody's responsible. Why? Because no politician wanted to be responsible. You're talking about trains and subways and fare increases. And no politician wants to be the one who suggested a fare increase. No politician wants to be responsible for late trains. So they came up with the MTA so everyone could point fingers at somebody else! I can say, it's not me, I don't have majority over the board and the capital plan can be overridden by the Mayor or the Speaker or the Senate Leader. The Mayor of New York can say, I only have four, so I don't control—Speaker Carl Heastie can say, all I get to do is veto, I don't have anyone on the board. Everybody can point fingers, but nobody has responsibility and nobody has authority. I am telling you, that is the fundamental problem with the MTA. If there is not someone's name on the line, the bureaucracy governs and fills the void and that's where we are with the MTA."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"It is at a crucial period with the MTA. We have a lot of big projects going on, and it is a crucial point in terms of operation. We're doing the Long Island Rail Road Transformation, which is a very complicated plan. We're in the middle of the L-Train Tunnel restoration, which was a very complicated program which just underwent significant changes but, would have impacted 225,000 riders if it was done incorrectly. We have to expand the Second Avenue Subway, we have to finish the new Moynihan Train Hall, which is across the street from Penn. We have to finish the Eastside Access Project in our lifetime. I promised my daughters they would not have to worry about the Eastside Access. But it has been long overdue. It is very complicated and it has to be seized and it has to be finished. And day to day, the train operations are failing. The stations are not clean, the trains are late, they're not moving quickly enough. And it can be a major impediment to the entire region's growth. That's what the MTA could be. 9 million MTA riders, almost half the people in the state of New York ride the MTA, believe it or not."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Now, we propose a reliable funding stream so we don't have to fight about this every year and they can plan it. I propose first, what's called congestion pricing. Congestion pricing is—some people actually know what it is, I'm surprised. Congestion pricing has electronic tolling for vehicles that enter what we call the Manhattan Central Business District. 60th Street and south is the Central Business District. It provides toll equity, meaning everybody pays the same toll when you go into the zone. It stops what we call ""bridge shopping."" Now, I'm a Queens boy. You can take the 59th Street bridge and not pay a toll or you can go through the Queens-Midtown tunnel and pay a toll. I'm cheap, so I go through the 59th Street Bridge. But literally you are directing traffic by where there's a toll-free bridge and where there's not a toll-free bridge. This would say, basically, everyone pays the toll if you're going into the Central Business District. There would be no toll on the FDR. So if you're just coming into Manhattan to go north or south there's no toll on the FDR. We estimate that would raise about $15 billion in capital through congestion pricing. The next question is, is that enough money, the $15 billion, to solve the problems? We don't think so. Especially with the New York City Transit Authority. We think there's going to be a shortfall. Facts on the New York City Transit Authority, this was all done in the 60s. New York City owns the New York City Transit Authority, the trains, the stationleases it to the MTA. The law on the books said that as New York City owns it, they should pay for the capital funding, but allowed New York State to contribute to the capital funding starting when New York City had a fiscal crisis in the 1980s. New York State funding over the years - the past 30 years, if you look at how we paid for capital funding: New York City paid about 60 percent of the capital cost, New York State paid about 40 percent. That changed dramatically in the last capital plan where the state put in about 75 percent of the capital. We funded a record level of capital at $8 billion, and we're proud of it."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Underfunding capital for the past 30 or 40 years has brought us to where we are. That's how you have subway cars that are 40-50 years old, and electric switches that are 100 years old. So this is an investment that has to be made. If there is a shortfall in the funding after congestion pricing, I propose a 50-50 revenue split between New York City and New York State on the additional capital. Last year we had something called the Subway Action Plan which the legislature had to find. We split that 50-50 between New York City and New York State. I think it's fair to New York City; I think it's also fair to Long Island and Buffalo and Westchester and I don't have a problem saying to anyone across the state keeping that system running helps the entire state. And it is worth splitting the cost with New York City, to make the investment we should've made for decades to keep that transportation system vital. And more than anything we have to do it this year, because the status quo has got to go. Riders are fed up, the situation only gets worse. It's like the old commercial: you can pay me now or you can pay me later. The system is just continuing to deteriorate and if we don't invest now we're going to pay more later and suffer in the meantime. Let's address the MTA. Let's do it this year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We also have to make progress all across the state. Keep building the economy. We've done $70 billion in construction in the first term, $100 billion in the second. I want to do $150 billion in this third term. We would be leading the nation of all the states in actually building a new transportation system and infrastructure. The economy comes to the state with the transportation and infrastructure. And that's why it's coming to New York and we should keep doing that."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We'll provide $4.4 billion for upstate roads and bridges. That's part of the $29 billion, five-year plan. $568 in non-MTA transit systems, upstate transit systems. Also $750 million for the REDCs which have been doing great work all across the state. $100 million for our Downtown Revitalization Initiative, which ESD and Howard Zemsky have been promoting around the state. It's been marvelous all across the state, especially in upstate New York with those upstate areas are being revitalized."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Middle class tax cuts: fight SALT, fight SALT, fight SALT. It is a 30 percent tax increase for many New Yorkers. 30 percent tax increase. We pay the highest property taxes in the nation. We pay the highest property taxes in the nation in upstate New York, as a percentage of home value. This says anything over $10,000 you can no longer deduct. I believe not only that's why we saw the $3 billion hole in our revenues, I believe you're going to see a revenue crisis in this state and I believe you're going to see a housing crisis in this state. Because if I can't deduct my property taxes and it's going up 30 percent and I'm already paying the highest property taxes in the United States, that is a significant disincentive. And I believe the federal government knew exactly what they were doing. They put us in a position where we are not economically as competitive as the other states. We have to reverse SALT. We made legal changes to find ways around SALT. They don't want to. We're suing the federal government, and that's the only way we're going to get this done."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have a democratic delegation in the Congress - I met with them last week - and I said this has to be on the top priorities. In the meantime, as our middle class homeowners are feeling this pressure, and middle class taxpayers, I want to give them some relief and show them that we hear them and know the pain that they're under and let's lower the middle class tax rate from 6.85 percent to 5.5 percent, and 6.85 percent to 6 percent. Remember, we've already made the tax code much more progressive with more brackets and more tranches and you see it in the numbers. The top earners now pay 20% more and the middle class burden has dropped by 27 percent. So we have a real progressive tax code, but I think lowering taxes for the middle class is a very positive signal to send and I would make permanent the local property tax cap at 2 percent. That is the only that is going to tell people. I understand if New York City does not feel the property tax cap issue the same way Long Island and upstate does. Because it's not the same issue. They don't have that same burden of property tax. Between Nassau and Westchester, you're number one and number two in the nation. You have property taxes of $20, 30, 40,000 in those counties. It makes a real difference, and that SALT lack of deduction makes a real difference. At least if we can say the 2 percent is going to be adhered to, I think it will help give people confidence in the system. That property tax cap has saved the typical homeowner $3,200 already, so it's making a difference in people's lives."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have an opportunity to stand up and be the most progressive state in the United States on women's leadership issues and we should do it. Let's start with a constitutional amendment on Roe v. Wade, pass RHA, CCA. Pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Ensure access to IVF and fertility preservation coverage. Reduce the maternal mortality and morbidity rate, and address the racial disparities that are disgusting. Outlaw non-consensual revenge porn. Eliminate the statute of limitations for rape and modernize the pay equity laws. And let's be the first state and let's show this nation what real women's equality means. And not just talking the talking, but we're going to walk the walk and we're going to do it this year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Protect New Yorkers from emerging health risks. The more we know about chemicals in water and food, the more frightening the situation is. There are 1,000 known carcinogens that are in products that are used every day. We want to pass a consumer right to know act that labels those products that have those carcinogens. I believe we will save lives by raising the smoking law from 18 to 21 years old. I think we should invest $200 million in fighting the scourge of the opioid crisis. It is rampant across the state. It is moving like fire through dry grass. We spent $1.5 million over nine years. If I had more money, I would quadruple it. We're losing young people every day. We have to do everything we can, and $200 million for comprehensive care, I believe, will save our young people's lives."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We'll lead the way with the most aggressive environmental agenda, while the federal government is taking us backwards from the Paris Accords and so forth. We're going to go the exact opposite direction of the federal government. $2.5 billion in clean water infrastructure. A record high $300 million EPF. The Grumman Plume on Long Island, the discussion has gone on for decades. It is a toxic chemical that is moving through Long Island and steadily moving towards the coast. It is poisoning the wells as it goes. It's been left by the Grumman Corporation when they were manufacturing. We've been talking for decades. Grumman doesn't want to pay, the Navy doesn't want to pay. Let us say we'll do the remediation and then we're going to sue you to get the money back, but we have to keep our people safe."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"I want to invest another 3.6 million in the shellfish restoration program, which is Mother Nature's way of cleaning and filtering the water. Oysters, shellfish, especially in the downstate area. We've had great success with that and Stony Brook is doing a great job at their hatchery. Let's give them a round of applause. The federal government wants to allow offshore drilling off the coast of Long Island and off the coast of Manhattan. One spill and you would poison the entire harbor. We have to pass a law that stops that and we have to do it this session. Sometimes there's just a common sense issue."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"You look at the damage done by plastic bags, it is everywhere. Hanging from trees, in water, in every community across the state. Let's once and for all step up. I know it's not easy, I know everyone has an opinion. Let's expand the Bottle Bill and let's ban plastic bags once and for all. And let's take the next step on the Green New Deal which tackles climate change and starts building the green economy for tomorrow. We know it's coming, let the economy be here."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Let us set the goal: 100 percent clean power by 2040. Highest in the United States of America. The Climate Action Council to eliminate the state's carbon footprint and let's get SUNY ESF to work with the REDC's to come up with that next little generation of technology and train our workforce for those jobs. Offshore wind has potential, we know it, the industry is moving that way. We want to locate the industry in this state and we want to use it as an alternative. Let's invest $1.5 million, it's a real source for renewable energy, and let's do it this year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have communities that are closing old, inefficient power plants. It causes a problem because they lose the property taxes from those old plants. We want those old plants closed, we want more efficient plants, but let's provide a fund that gives the communities the transition from the loss of that property tax revenue and that's a $70 million property tax compensation fund so those communities don't shoulder the burden themselves."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have record tourism in this state and it's nice that people come to see us and it makes me feel good about ourselves and who we are. But even more it brings money to this state, not that I'm money conscious. 2017, a new record in tourism. 244 million visitors, it's a $100 billion industry. More visitors to our State Parks than ever before in history and that's part of the tourism number. Why? Because we're investing in our parks, we're investing in our assets. People have something to see. Let's continue that with another $110 million on our New York Parks 2020. Hudson River Park, State Park is magnificent. It's on the west side of Manhattan. It was started by Governor Mario Cuomo and Mayor David Dinkins. Let Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio finally finish that park and $23 million to make it a reality."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Our focus on craft breweries and wineries has worked with tourism. It has been an explosion in activity - quadrupled the number of breweries, the number of wineries up by about 40 percent. That's because we've been promoting I Love New York and our taste products. We should continue doing that. They're selling, they're delicious, they're healthy, and it's also great for the economy. So it's a win-win."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"At this time, in this nation, let New York stand up for immigrants. Let's pass the Jose Peralta Dream Act, as an honor to Jose Peralta and his leadership and his memory. God bless him and God bless his family."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We have the first in the Nation Liberty defense project, which is a state lead public-private project to assist immigrants regardless of status in obtaining legal services and resources. We want to continue that and expand it. We should codify, what I did by executive order because I couldn't get it passed by the senate. Executive Order number 170—state agencies cannot inquire about immigration status. It prevents ICE arrests."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We sued the federal government on their family separation policy and I want to continue that lawsuit because that was a disgusting political abuse of power. And just today, the courts have decided that the citizenship question that was in the census was illegal. Congratulations to the Attorney General's office that lead the suit. Now let's go out there and count every New Yorker so we get what we deserve in the state of New York."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Homelessness and affordable housing very simply $20 billion which is the largest commitment to affordable housing this state has ever made. But let's - you should keep applauding I didn't mean to interrupt you - this year, this year, we have the opportunity to finally reform the rent regulation program, including eliminating vacancy decontrol, ending preferential rent limits, limiting building and apartment improvement charges, and strengthening the tenant protection unit so we actually enforce those laws."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"When it comes to our labor unions, they are under attack by the Supreme Court. They are under attack by the federal administration. Our state Department of Labor will aggressively protect the right to organize and collectively bargain. Let's extend the Janus protection to all local governments in the state of New York and project construction with public subsidies should be subject to the prevailing wage so they're built right, they're built fairly, they're build union. And that's long overdue and let's get it passed this session and let's show our brothers and sisters in organized labor who may be timid, who may be quiet, who may be shy, but we're with you anyway. I still can't hear you, you're still too shy for me. I love doing that."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"When it comes to public safety, over the past two years we spent a hundred millions dollars to fight MS-13 the fight goes on, let's invest another $45 million dollar in anti-gang operations, violence prevention, and school base support. We have a growing problem of online sexual offenses against children. We want to launch a specialized police unit to prosecute these predators, nothing could be worse. Let's pass the New York City speed camera laws and stop playing politics that they did last year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And the Child Victims Act. The Child Victims Act has been too long denied. I am fully aware of the position of the Catholic Church and the opposition of the Catholic Church. I happen to be Roman Catholic. I'm a former altar boy and my relationship with the church is important to me and I've found the differences painful over the years. The difference on marriage equality, the difference on a woman's right to choose, and the difference on the Child Victims Act. But a wise man said, ""the abuse of minors is an offense so brutal, the church cannot remain indifferent to this, and the church must punish such priests, and that includes to support the legal action. There is no other way out of this because it's a crime. No worse, it's leaving them alive, but destroyed."" That is a true statement, and the Catholic Church should understand that, and that statement was made by Pope Francis and I say we stand with Pope Francis and we pass the Child Victims Act this year because if you believe in justice for all, then you believe in passing the Child Victims Act and follow the leadership of Pope Francis."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"When it comes to criminal justice agenda, you should all be proud. Since 2011, we have closed more prisons than any administration in the history of the state of New York, period. This year we are going to eliminate cash bail. We have to enact speedy trial reform, we have to pass discovery reform, and we need to do more services for re-entry for those transitioning from incarceration back to the community. We also have to invest $100 million to make our Raise the Age reform a reality and we have to do it this year."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And New York has to establish a regulated adult-use cannabis program. We had an expert group—State Police, Department of Health come together. They did a report. They said the benefits outweigh the risks. Now we just have to put it in place, and we have to do it in a way that creates an economic opportunity for poor communities and people who paid the price, and not for rich corporations that are going to come in to make a buck. It reduces the impact of criminalization on communities of colors. It will automatically seal certain cannabis-related criminal records. It implements quality control. Counties and large cities can opt out so we're not telling them what to do, but they have to affirmatively opt out of the program. No one under 21 years old. It generates approximately $300 million in tax revenue and creates good union jobs that we need."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"This is the outline of the overall statewide investments. These are the various offices. This is the overall budget. What's called the ""all funds"" budget, brings our budget up to $175 billion. The percentage change is 1.9 percent. School goes up 1.6. State Medicare goes up 3.6. The remainder of the agencies are basically flat. How much each priority costs us. Education is 27 billion dollars, that's a 3.6 increase. Health care is a $19 billion investment, that's a 3.6 increase. $15 billion is congestion pricing. $150 billion is our statewide construction initiative. The middle class tax cut is $1.8 billion, but I believe if we don't keep our middle class and we don't control their taxes, we're going to have an issue long term."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Last issue is insuring the public trust. If you read the headlines over the past few years, they have been continuous and they have been disappointing, and they have been disgraceful, and they have been widespread. It looks terrible and it is terrible. Now, we will never stop venial, greedy, ignorant, behavior by people. And we shouldn't be expected to do that, but we should be expected to do everything we can to have a system in place that safeguards against fraud or theft, and there it is a continuing battle, but there I believe we can do more to ensure the public trust."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We want to enact a public Code of Conduct for lobbyists that stops self-dealing and conflicts of interest so everybody knows who they're working for. We want to have in the code, we ban the revolving door between a political consultant, who then becomes a lobbyist, to go back and lobby against or for the person that he or she just elected. That is a clear conflict of interest. We expand the lobbying ban for all policy makers and elected officials who would then lobby before their own agency or administration. Disclose conflicts of interests. Require lobbyists to disclose campaign contributions to JCOPE and increase penalties for lobbyists who fail to file to disclose. If the legislature doesn't want to enact this code of conduct, the executive will unilaterally impose it upon itself. So those lobbyists who do not agree to that Code of Conduct cannot lobby the executive."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"Contract procurement review must be performed and government must function on a timely basis. I don't believe one is the enemy of the other. Yes, review contracts, but yes let's get it done quickly because government has to function and we have to get things done. Comptroller DiNapoli and I have agreed on a new process to implement procurement reforms. I will direct SUNY, CUNY and OGS to allow the Office of the state Comptroller to pre-audit contracts in excess of $250,000, but the pre-audit must be done in 30 days and for the first time the office of the state Comptroller provides its contracts in excess of $250,000 to the state IG to audit for fraud and hiring practices. I want to publicly thank, the Comptroller for his good work and his cooperation. Thank you."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"The State will also require new legal certifications for contracts between a grantor and a grantee. Any state agency that is assuring or issuing a grant has to certify that there was no occlusion, there was no political interference. Disclose any payments they may have received. Disclose any prior relationship. For non-competitive contracts it would be the same with the agency official and the legislature if there's one involved. Today I'm issuing an Executive Order, number 192, to stop what we call bad vendors. Any contractor or vendor who is deemed barred, or deemed non responsible by one agency"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,—that will be binding on all other agencies and all other entities.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"We also have to combat big money in politics. We will ban corporate contributions to candidates. Close the LLC loophole. Create a public financing system with a six to one match. Reduce the various contribution limits for statewide and local offices. Candidates for legislature should disclose five years of taxes. Bring sunlight and sunshine. Statewide office I think should be 10 years of taxes disclosed. We also have to address the issue of IE's. I understand the federal case law. But, this now a loophole that is swallowing the law. It is a joke to talk about a $4,000 limit, a $5,000 limit in public finance but then an IE, Independent Expenditure Committee, dark money can come in and spend millions in that race and overwhelm everything. You have PACs who launder money to IE's which is illegal. You have 501(c)(3)'s that donate to a 501(c)(4). You have dark money that makes a number of contributions to a number of 501(c)s—which are tax exempt. They get the tax deduction—and then contribute it to the 501(c)(4). These loopholes make the entire campaign system fraught for a lack of integrity. You want to talk about franchising individuals who now feel disenfranchised—a corporation a large contributor with a $10 million check can buy an election and nobody knows who he or she is. First of all, it's a tax fraud. And the State Department of Tax and Finance has to get on the stick and do its job. Second, we have to pass laws that clean up this system and close these IE loopholes."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,The old Senate wouldn't pass a Freedom of Information Law that was binding on the legislature. it's been proposed before by a number of legislators. They were right and they were visionary. Let's apply a Freedom of Information Law to the Executive and to the Legislature.
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"My friends, we can make history. I believe that. I believe we can have the most productive first 100 days in state history. I believe we are in a fundamentally different space and in the old days too many good ideas went to the state Senate to die. Now we're going to have good ideas going to the state Senate to be born. And I think we should take advantage of this opportunity. I was having a conversation with Leader Stewart-Cousins this morning and she said we have a moment in time, we have a moment in time. Which is true. And if you think about it, that's all we really have. A moment in time. 40 years, we haven't had a democratic Senate, Assembly and Governor. Besides one brief period. 40 years. We have a moment in time to change the state. We can do it. It's just us. We are in control. There is no one else. And I believe that together, we can do it."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"For my younger friends, I'm sorry you missed the opportunity to have the counsel of one of the real great public servants. And one of the things my father said was—in campaigns, it's about what you say. In government, it's all about what you do. And the great ones know the difference. The great ones know the difference. The great ones know the difference. The time for talking is over. It is the time for doing. Government's credibility comes from accomplishing. From performing. Nobody wants to hear ""I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this. I think this, I think this, I think this."" Have you done anything that would lead me to suggest that you can do anything that's going to help me, right? And that's where we're running into frustration with the body politic. People have real problems—they haven't had enough help in their life. And that's what government is supposed to do. And that's what the great ones do. And I believe in this moment with this legislature, I believe we have great ones at the table. And I believe great ones can actually make this a moment in history."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And leadership, by great ones, is about passing all the bills and balancing the budget. But it's also about something else. It's about providing leadership in the moment. And leadership at a time of turmoil and loss and this nation in this moment is lost. It is freighting what is happening. The number of anti-Semitic attacks are up 90 percent in New York State. In New York State, 90 percent. Neo-Nazi groups up 22 percent. Hate crimes up every year. Think about that. After all we've gone through. The social fabric is unraveling. Yes, we have to do something practically about it and we're going to spend more money for our non-public schools making sure they're safe. A diversity agenda in schools. We'll increase the penalty on hate crimes. But it's more than that."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"New York is different than the other states. We are the laboratory for the American experiment in democracy. It all started here. They got off the boat, they were brought in chains. They came here first. We are 19 million people. From every spot on the globe in the most dense location in the country if not in the world. And we are more sophisticated and we have gone through this situation. We get it. We know it. We know what is going on out there. People are angry, people are frustrated. And that anger turns to a fear. And the fear turns to a division. And people are now angry one at another. And we have a federal government that is fanning the flames of fear. Why? Because they believe it works for them. They believe it works for them. Divide and conquer. Divide by race. Divide by religion. Divide by income. It's not a new or novel tactic. It's an old and ugly tactic. And what happens is you're spreading an American cancer where one cell in the body attacks other cells in the body. And the body consumes itself. It has to stop."
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"And this is not just anti-New York. This anti-American. The motto of this nation—that is on the seal of the nation, that is on the flag behind the President's desk—says E Pluribus Unum. Out of many, one. That's the concept that founded the nation. Bring all these different faces, bring all these different people from all these different places together as one. That's what founded the country. And the hypocrisy—I did my inaugural at Ellis Island just to make this point. You know who came through Ellis Island? A gentleman named Richard Cawley. A poor Irish immigrant who came during the potato famine. You know who his grandson is? Vice President Michael Pence. You know who else came through New York harbor? Frederick Trump, grandfather of Donald Trump. The greatest arrogance is when you forget where you came from, and where you started, and this is the greatest arrogance. We all came from somewhere else. We are all immigrants. Unless you are a Native American—you are an immigrant. Why, you're not an Immigrant, Joe? You were here on the Mayflower?"
New York,Andrew Cuomo,Democrat,"My friends, my friends—they call us on our seal. It says the Great State of New York. The Great State of New York. You know why New York is great? Because New York rejects divide and conquer and we believe in unify and grow. New York is great because we believe in community and mutuality and we believe the greatest feast has the most number of people at the table. And we believe in shared success and cooperation. And we believe when one is lifted we are all lifted. We are great because we believe the strongest four-letter word is still love. Not hate. And we are strong enough to say it. We are great because our motto is I Love New York. But that New York loves you. New York loves you if you are L or G or B or T or Q, if you are black or white or brown, if you are a Christian, a Muslim, or if you are Jewish. If you are a new immigrant or an old immigrant. New York loves you and what makes us great is we have no tolerance for hate in our state. That's New York. And that's who we are. And that's our message to this nation. Thank you and God bless you."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, Members of the General Assembly, Council of State, Judiciary and my Cabinet and fellow North Carolinians:"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"The North Carolina Constitution directs the governor come to the legislature, to and I quote, “give to the General Assembly information of the affairs of the State and recommend to their considerations such measures as he shall deem expedient” end quote."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Our Constitution mandates that we work together to make North Carolina better, and it charges the governor to participate in the legislative process. That constitutional directive, and your kind invitation, is why I come tonight."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"I didn’t come alone. In the gallery are four strong women whom I thank for their never-ending love and support: First Lady, Kristin Cooper, and my daughters Hilary, Natalie and Claire."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,I want to begin by reporting to you that the state of our state is promising.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"It is promising because of our universities and community colleges, because of our farms and factories, our Research Triangle Park, our banking headquarters, but most of all because of the hardworking people of this state who want it to succeed."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"North Carolina is one of the fastest-growing states in America. By 2025, we will have one million more residents. Many of these people will come to North Carolina because we are the state of promise."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"People come because of the climate. The mountains and coast. The schools and higher education. They come because of good jobs and opportunity. And people come to our state for the promise of a great life and of good communities. And when they come here, they are welcomed."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,There is warmth in the nodding of heads as we walk down the sidewalk. There is a welcoming handshake at the ball field. There are the open arms of entire communities welcoming home veterans who served our country. Our people are welcoming.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Our people are welcoming.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,But some of our laws are not.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"I’m going to say this first thing because of the urgency and to go ahead and get it out of the way. Tonight, I call on the legislature once again to repeal House Bill 2. The law has damaged our state. The legislature must erase this law from our books. Pass a clean repeal of HB2 and I will sign it the same day."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Pass a compromise repeal that works to eliminate discrimination and brings back jobs, sports and entertainment and I will sign it – as long as it truly gets the job done."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,I also raise this issue at the beginning because HB2 is the dark cloud hanging over our state of promise. It drains the energy from what should be our work for the people of this state.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Citizens from Cherokee to Chocowinity are sick of it and they are wondering when we’re going to cut away this heavy anchor weighing us down. Let’s do it this week. It’s time to move on.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"HB2 might be a dark cloud, but even the darkest clouds blow over, and I believe we are a state of promise at our core."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Being elected to serve the people of every county, every city, every legislative district, and every community in between helps me realize just how big and diverse our state really is."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"It also demands that we listen to the concerns of the people who will hold us accountable, whether they voted for us or not."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"I bring their concerns to you today, boiled down this way: I want North Carolinians to be better educated, healthier and have more money in their pockets."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Too many people feel stuck in the middle – not wealthy by any measure, but doing just well enough that the social safety net isn’t there for them. They feel left behind by a system that isn’t listening to them and an economy that isn’t rewarding them for their hard work."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"The budget I shared two weeks ago reflects the priorities of North Carolina’s hard-working people. It contains no increase in taxes. It rejects the false “either/or” choice of either saving or investing. Instead, my budget puts hundreds of millions of dollars in our rainy day fund while committing to a future of growth."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,I call this budget “Common Ground Solutions” because it contains many areas of agreement.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"In Raleigh, partisan battles, power struggles and lawsuits might grab the headlines, but we have to work together where we can. To look beyond ourselves to see what’s right for the state, regardless of who’s in power."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"That’s what the people of North Carolina want us to do, and what common sense demands us to do. So let’s get to work."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Job recruitment, raising teacher pay, fighting the opioid crisis, boosting our infrastructure and recovering from natural disasters that have damaged our communities. These are areas where we already agree more than we disagree. These tasks don’t come with a party label for a reason. They are priorities we all share."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Let me first address making North Carolinians better educated. As I have traveled the width and breadth of North Carolina, it doesn’t matter where I am or who I’m talking to, people want us to make education better."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"When I’m recruiting a business to come here - to your legislative districts, the first thing they ask is whether North Carolina has the workers skilled enough to fill the jobs they create."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Improving education is an area where we can find common ground. We have to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"That’s why I’ve laid out aggressive goals to make North Carolina a Top Ten Educated State by 2025 – emphasizing early childhood education, increasing enrollment in pre-kindergarten, improving our high school graduation rate and increasing the percentage of adults with a higher education degree."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"My budget creates nearly 4,700 additional Pre-Kindergarten slots to eliminate the wait-list of at-risk four year olds. Getting more kids in pre-K means they’ll arrive at school ready to learn. It’s the foundation for a lifetime of success, showing economic and health benefits well beyond their pre-K years. And it allows both parents to stay in the workforce, a necessity for many North Carolina families."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Top CEOs in our state are promoting early childhood education because they know it makes a difference. Research proves that investing in quality early childhood education generates high returns, where $1 of investment yields $7 in return or even higher."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"To help families afford the cost of quality childcare, I’m also proposing that we reinstate the Child Care and Dependent Tax Credit, which also applies to those caring for aging parents."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"As our children move from early childhood to grade school, we entrust our teachers with their futures every single day. Let’s put our money where our trust is and raise teacher salaries."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"My plan gives an average 10% raise over the next two years. On this pace, we can bring teacher salaries up to best in the Southeast in three years and to at least the national average in five years."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"And my budget gives every single teacher a raise, valuing the experienced teachers as well as those new to the job."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Wendell Tabb, with us here tonight, is a 30-year veteran teacher in Durham whose experience in the classroom is a benefit for his students, and other teachers. Wendell is here representing thousands of veteran teachers who are making education better."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Thanks for all you do, Wendell!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Despite paychecks stretched too thin already, our teachers often dip into their own pockets to buy basic school supplies. Wake County teacher Jasmine Lauer, who is here with us tonight, is all too familiar with this crunch. She wants her students to have everything they need. For her, that means buying books for her students online, one at a time, until they eventually have a full set. Jasmine represents so many selfless teachers who want their students to have what they need. Thanks for your sacrifice, Jasmine!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"My budget proposes an annual $150 supply bonus to help teachers cover the cost of supplies. It won’t cover everything, but it’s a tangible sign of our appreciation and respect."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We’re also joined tonight by Sabrina Peacock, a teacher from Guilford County. Sabrina entered the classroom as a North Carolina Teaching Fellow and today teaches 3rd grade at Oak Hill Elementary, a Title One school, working to ensure that every student has access to a quality education."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We must recruit our best students to become teachers. That’s why my budget would create $10,000 Best and Brightest scholarships for students who commit to spending three to four years in the classroom, like Sabrina did. I understand some legislators want to do this, too. Let’s find common ground so we can get more of these great teachers. Thanks for bringing your talents to the teaching profession, Sabrina!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"In my talks with business owners, I hear time and again that they have job openings, but can’t find workers with the skills necessary to fill them."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We know the problem and we have the answer: educated workers with high-tech critical thinking skills, earned at our high schools, community colleges and universities."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"To give people in the middle class more opportunity to afford higher education, let’s pass a workforce program we call NC GROW - Getting Ready for Opportunities in the Workforce. It means free community college—a scholarship to cover last-dollar tuition and fees for recent high school graduates to attend a North Carolina community college."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"To earn it, young people have to make good grades and apply for already-existing scholarships, loans and grant programs. It’s an idea that Republican and Democratic governors alike have supported in other states. We can make it a bipartisan reality here in North Carolina."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Yes, there’s a price tag on these investments in education. But now that the economy is rebounding, it’s time to make smart, strategic investments in our people."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,We cannot sacrifice education at the altar of even more corporate tax cuts or giveaways that are mostly for the wealthiest. Changes to our tax code need to focus on relief for working families – not corporations and millionaires.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Next, let’s work together to get more money in the pockets of North Carolina families by bringing and growing more good-paying jobs to our state and to your legislative districts."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"One of the most important steps that the legislature can take is to fund our education budget. An educated workforce is a competitive workforce, and companies are in a global search for talent. Let’s take advantage of our intellectual capital."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"There are other strategic steps we can take to make our state more competitive – funding to prepare mega-sites to attract large-scale, advanced manufacturing."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Workforce technical training that is more nimble and customized to what companies say they need.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Encouraging more people to get into high-paying trades, like plumbing and electrical work, or medical research and high tech engineering."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Incentives to bring the film industry back to North Carolina. Initiatives to harness the innovation and entrepreneurship happening right now at our world-class universities and in our cities.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Encouraging renewable energy which is already bringing good jobs to our state.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Providing help for small business. And a focus on rural broadband access, which is a must for economic success in our rural communities. We cannot leave them behind."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Tonight we’re joined by Charlotte Vick. Vick Family Farms in Wilson has expanded its sweet potato crops in recent years and is rapidly increasing production to meet global demand, including building a new 50,000 square foot packaging facility."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Sixty percent of Vick Family Farms’ customer base is overseas and access to broadband internet has allowed the company to compete, manage shipments, and grow their business."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We must do more to help rural small businesses and family farms grow. High-speed broadband access is key to their success, in fact, a necessity, in a global marketplace. Thanks for your hard work and innovation, Charlotte!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Finally, our economy is recovering. But our unemployment rate is still 5.3 percent, the same as last January, and that is still slightly above the national average. Meanwhile, our Unemployment Trust Fund has grown to more than two billion dollars."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"That’s good. But we must use this opportunity and these funds to help for those who can’t find work, while also taking a deeper look at those who are chronically unemployed."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,The Governor and the legislature need to work together to get better-paying jobs for North Carolina. We have good opportunities to make that happen in the coming months.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We also need to see that North Carolinians are healthier. While we’ve made progress in getting more people health insurance, we still have an alarming gap in coverage that we’re all paying for with high-priced indigent care."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Yet there’s a new healthcare landscape in our country, filled with uncertainty. We have to sit down and have serious discussions about improving access to care for people who don’t have it."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Most of these are people who work hard but find it tough to afford to see a doctor. We also have rural hospitals that struggle to stay open and provide good health care across the state.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"If we work together, we can improve the health of thousands of North Carolinians."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"One of the most frightening developments in our country and state is the opioid and substance abuse crisis. It threatens lives, rips apart families and can create a shortage of qualified workers."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"In my hometown of Nashville, North Carolina, Police Chief Tom Bashore is working to combat this addiction crisis. Last February, Chief Bashore and the Nashville Police Department launched the “Hope Initiative,” the first program in North Carolina encouraging opioid addicts to walk into a police station seeking treatment without fear of arrest."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Recognizing that addiction is a disease, Chief Bashore has engaged with the community to eliminate the stigma surrounding opioid addiction and encourage addicts to seek treatment. He knows that prevention is part of strong and effective law enforcement. I’m proud to have Chief Bashore join us here tonight. We must support his work and the work of those offering treatment in communities across our state. Thanks, Chief!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,My budget directs mental health and law enforcement funding in a multi-pronged approach to combat the substance abuse crisis. This is an area where we must find common ground to help our friends and neighbors gripped by addiction.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Being healthy also means clean air and water. An emphasis on renewable energy can achieve that, and it will help our economy sustain good-paying jobs. We’ve seen the positive results already."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Finally, I urge cooperation as we work to rebuild the thousands of homes, businesses, schools and roads damaged by last year’s storms. No solution is as easy or as quick as we want it to be, but I pledge to continue working with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and you in the General Assembly to help residents rebuild in those 50 hard-hit counties."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We have made progress in a few key categories that I am pleased to report to you tonight. In just the past couple of months, we’ve been able to repair and reopen more than 100 roads, and help hundreds of families return home or find other places to live."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"But nearly 600 households are still in need of permanent housing. We will not forget these families, and must keep working together to help them."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"One thing that has become clear during the disaster recovery is the lack of affordable, available housing in eastern North Carolina that has hindered relocation efforts. That’s why I am asking you to work with me to restore allowing the use of federal money for housing so we can start to build our way out of this affordable housing shortage."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Tonight, we have a remarkable young lady with us who represents the very best of our state’s resilient spirit. In 2015, before the storm, 12-year-old Mackenzie Hinson, from Grantham, founded “Make A Difference Food Pantry” to help people in her community. After the devastation of Hurricane Matthew, Mackenzie and her volunteers went into overdrive. Following the hurricane, her pantry’s shelves were empty and friends and family members lost homes."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"But Mackenzie and her team were not deterred. With the help of businesses and volunteers, they restocked and got to work."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"After Hurricane Matthew, Make A Difference Food Pantry was open for 42 straight days, serving 6,914 hot meals and distributing food boxes and toiletry items to over 8,000 people in Wayne, Johnston, and Sampson counties."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Mackenzie, thank you for being here tonight and for being an inspiration. By following your example, we will rebuild our communities and be a stronger state than ever. Good work, Mackenzie!"
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,Serving the people of North Carolina is the honor of my lifetime.
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Standing in this well tonight, I’m reminded of my years in these seats, serving with Democratic and Republican governors who worked together to solve problems."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"You make the decision to sacrifice your privacy, time with family and in some cases, your income, to be here. For that, I salute you."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"When we take the oath of office, we take on the weight of tremendous responsibility. A responsibility to uphold our constitution, in voting laws, in classrooms, in health care. To act in the best interest of the people who elected us. To leave North Carolina better than we found it."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"To do that, we must put politics aside and work together. And in order to maintain North Carolina as a state of promise, I will make a few promises."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"I promise to listen, to engage, to build consensus, to compromise when possible. I promise to fight only when we can’t come to agreement or when you leave me no choice. I promise to make sure state government employs people who look like the people it represents."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"To find the common ground we seek, let’s listen to North Carolinians urging us to set aside divisive social issues and political power struggles. Instead, let’s focus on teacher pay and jobs — the issues families face and talk about every day around their kitchen tables."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"Back in the late 1990s, this House was controlled by Republicans while I was in the Senate, controlled by Democrats. We disagreed and fought. And I spent many late nights here, talking and negotiating. But we found common ground on raising teacher salaries to the national average. We found common ground on expanding Smart Start and cutting taxes for the middle class. Republicans and Democrats can find common ground if we work on it."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"We can find common ground on education. We can find common ground on health care and the opioid epidemic. We can find common ground on raising the juvenile age. We will find common ground on jobs, economic development and further hurricane and wildfire recovery. We will find this agreement because too much is at stake if we don’t."
North Carolina,Roy Cooper,Democrat,"The people of North Carolina are watching us. Over the next few months, let’s fulfill our promise and demonstrate to North Carolina and beyond, that there is enough room for all of us on that common ground. God bless you, our country, and the great state of North Carolina."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Lieutenant Governor Rhoden, Mr. Speaker, members of the legislature, Chief Justice Gilbertson, Justices of the Supreme Court, constitutional officers and fellow South Dakotans. Thank you very much for giving me the challenge and the distinct honor of being your Governor."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,It is my privilege today to offer thoughts on the state of our state.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"By nearly every standard of comparison, South Dakota is in good shape. But in order to preserve and extend this prosperity forward for today’s working families and to the next generation, we must come together on solutions to the problems on the near and distant horizons."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Just how good do we have it here in South Dakota? Well, let’s compare to a few other states. Illinois is forecasting a $1.2 billion annual deficit and their pensions are only 40% funded. Connecticut’s economy has been shrinking for a decade and their revenue growth has stalled out. New Jersey has yearly budget deficits as far as the eye can see."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Meanwhile, in South Dakota, thanks to the leadership of Governor Dennis Daugaard and many in the legislature, we have rid our state of an annual structural deficit. We rely solely on the ongoing revenue stream to cover ongoing expenses. Our state pension plan is fully funded. And we have a Triple A credit rating - the highest rating given. I’m grateful for the voice of fiscal responsibility Governor Daugaard has maintained over the last eight years. I know he isn’t here today, but could you please join me in thanking Governor Daugaard and past legislators for their fiscal discipline and incredible leadership."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As our state’s new Governor, I’m committed to maintaining the fiscal integrity for which our state has become known. We will work hard to maintain that Triple A credit rating. We won’t spend money we don’t yet have. We won’t needlessly grow the government. We won’t raise taxes."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"If we stopped right there, those promises to the people of South Dakota would put us lightyears ahead of many other states. Fiscal discipline isn’t common elsewhere, but in our state it’s not optional. It’s the foundation. It’s what sets us apart with rating agencies and why our state makes list after list for being a great place to open a business, raise a family or retire."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,Fiscal discipline will be the foundation of my governorship but we aren’t going to stop there.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As I mentioned in my inaugural address last Saturday, I want to be a Governor who improves South Dakota not only for today, but also for the next generation. Growing up, my mom and dad worked hard to build a farm large enough for all of their kids to stay if they wanted to. My dad didn’t make it to see today, but his dream did. As much as he wanted us to carry on our family farm and ranch, what he really wanted was to give the next generation an opportunity to thrive. That dream is also my vision for South Dakota. The next generation is watching us and we must do everything we can to strengthen our state so it’s a place where they can one day launch their careers and raise their families. I hope you all will join me in this effort."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Over the past few weeks, my team and I have talked with every agency and department in state government. We have heard about the challenges and opportunities facing our state. This information transfer, though, was really the capstone of a two-year-long job interview for being our state's chief executive. And over the last two years, I was able to do a lot of listening with a lot of South Dakotans."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I heard story after story from South Dakota families about the love they have for our state. They love our culture, our wide open spaces, they love their towns and their churches. I do too. But many families are struggling to get ahead. Parents lie awake at night and wonder if they are a medical emergency away from financial disaster. Or if they’ll ever be able to put money into a savings account for a new home."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"With those stories of South Dakotans and the struggles that they face in mind, I want to share with you a handful of proposals that I believe will set up the next generation for success."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"For so many in South Dakota, our rural way of life keeps us connected to the land our grandfathers and grandmothers once farmed and to the close-knit communities we call home. But in the quiet moments, I think we would all acknowledge the world our kids will inherit will be a much different one than what we’ve experienced. Their world will be one in which both access and ease in a digital, connected world is a basic requirement for making a living. For being engaged in society, and keeping their households running and their kids educated."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I’ve heard it said that 65% of children in elementary school today will work in jobs that don’t exist yet. These jobs of the future – the jobs our children will depend on to support families of their own – will almost certainly require access to technology, particularly the Internet. And we must make those investments now. Raising the next generation with tools, such as broadband, is our responsibility as parents and citizens."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Internet access is taken for granted in urban settings but that’s not the case in rural areas. This is a big problem to tackle. There are many rural areas of our state where the lack of access to broadband is widespread. Half our counties have rural areas where one in four people don't have this kind of broadband access. And some counties have rural areas where half of the residents don’t have broadband access. They’re not even our most remote counties. Our citizens in rural Beadle and Codington counties, for example, endure poor internet access right alongside those living in rural Charles Mix and Perkins counties."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As I see it, this is a statewide, South Dakota issue, not just an urban versus rural issue. It’s a South Dakota issue because the small communities and rural areas near Watertown or Huron provide customers and members of the workforce for those larger communities. Some young girl with a aptitude for math and science could be a future Daktronics engineer but will she be able to excel without broadband at home?"
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"And some young man or woman might want to come back and take over the family farm but they need to have access to information on crops, prices and machinery. Their spouse might run a business online – Will they move back to the farm if they can’t access broadband? We must close the broadband gap to ensure people have the opportunity to work and hire locally and sell globally."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This is easier said than done. It can cost $15,000 per mile or more to lay fiber optic line for internet, and the low number of customers in some rural areas makes it too expensive for companies to justify their investment. Some have discouraged us from even trying to expand access because it’s too hard and too expensive. But I refuse to quit. Geographic location cannot be an excuse for the government to do nothing when the future vitality of our economy is at stake. Geographic location no longer has to be a barrier to participating in the global economy. By pairing quality of life, education targeted at in-demand fields, and fast, reliable broadband, I believe our geographic location can actually be an advantage. There’s no reason why rural South Dakota can’t compete and win by attracting new workers seeking a change. Let’s welcome our sons and daughters, who are tired of the crowds and commutes, back to their hometowns to raise families while pursuing their careers. And in the process we will strengthen our smaller communities and our state."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"So, how does that happen? Well, first we need to set goals as a state that will not only bring our homes and businesses up to an acceptable level of broadband access, but also ensure we remain at the forefront as technology develops. We’ll use those goals to drive our policy and ultimately our state’s investments. I feel strongly any time we are talking about taxpayer-funded investment, we should be investing for the long term, solving for more than just the immediate problem."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Today, I’m announcing a plan to close the broadband gap. Partnering with others, I want to connect as many more South Dakotans as possible to high speed internet over the next four years."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"State government can’t tackle this alone. To accomplish this goal, first, we’ll bring together industry leaders. Our state’s rural telecom companies, in particular, have considerable experience in bringing broadband service to our rural areas. Our state’s other wireline service providers have an important role to play in areas they serve as well, and I look forward to working with them on increasing their level of service. What’s more, I want to bring in companies with emerging technologies in the fixed wireless arena, such as Microsoft’s Airband initiative, that may offer more cost-efficient ways to provide fast, reliable service to our most difficult to serve locations. And I see a role for companies ready to invest in new 5G technology, which promises faster, more reliable service over cellular data networks, as well."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Second, we are going to focus state government’s commitment to this issue. My team will work on a mapping process to identify in more detail gaps or deficiencies in South Dakota’s broadband coverage. This will ensure we have the best possible picture of what work remains, and deploy our resources effectively to meet our goals."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Third, we are going to commit state resources to closing the broadband gap. Other states have developed programs and we will review those as we put our own together. State resources can’t, and shouldn’t, get us across the finish line alone. But they will incentivize investment and leverage additional dollars."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Going forward, I have also charged GOED with developing a series of public-private partnerships to help overcome the challenges of service in rural areas and achieve the ambitious goals we’ve set for South Dakota. In a state where our own Raven Aerostar has partnered with Google’s Loon project, which aims to bring Internet access to billions of people in rural areas around the globe through high altitude balloons, I know we can find a way to bridge our own challenges and secure broadband for rural South Dakota’s next generation and beyond."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"The rural nature of our state might create higher internet connection costs, but I wouldn’t trade it for the struggles and lifestyle that you have in DC or the coast of California. It’s hard to beat heading out on that special Saturday in October with family and friends to enjoy the Pheasant opener."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We recently celebrated a century of pheasant hunting here in South Dakota. It’s a tradition that my family has enjoyed for years. And for a period of time, it was more than a hobby, it was our livelihood. After my dad died, we opened a hunting lodge to help make ends meet. So to us, hunting isn’t just a sport. It’s a way of life, and an economic engine for our state. Today bird-hunters spend nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in South Dakota. And outdoor activities in our state support more than 18,000 full and part-time in-state jobs. That’s a huge boost to our economy."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"My family has been blessed with prime pheasant habitat on some of our land. Of course, we have worked hard to preserve those grounds over the years and have long participated in the CRP program. But as land values have increased, areas like ours have begun to disappear, gravely affecting pheasant populations. It’s hard to blame folks for making those decisions when land values are high but it has an impact on how and where our pheasant population can nest and produce the next season’s birds. In fact, statewide pheasant populations have fallen 65 percent in the last decade."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"While in the U.S. House, I authored a provision to increase CRP acres to 29 million acres, a priority for many South Dakota outdoorsmen. As Governor, I will continue to push federal policymakers to enhance CRP even further. But we can, and must, do more at the state level. Which is why I am announcing the official kickoff of our Second Century Initiative. The first century of pheasant hunting has put South Dakota on the map as a destination for every hunter. Now we must preserve and expand habitat to ensure that the second century of pheasant hunting will be as great as the first."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"First off, we’ll work to increase resources for habitat management – without raising taxes. Maintaining and improving habitat is essential to the future of pheasant hunting in South Dakota. So today, I am directing the Department of Game, Fish and Parks to explore outside-the-box, voluntary funding solutions, such as an expanded Hunt for Habitat program, in which a limited number of hunting tags would be reserved at premium pricing. Programs like this have proven exceptionally lucrative in neighboring states. All proceeds would again go directly to habitat."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We need South Dakotans thinking about pheasant habitat, not just in October as we’re cleaning up our shotguns, but year round. To raise visibility and more funds, I'll ask the Division of Motor Vehicles and Game, Fish and Parks to develop a specialty pheasant license plate program in which, again, all proceeds would go directly toward habitat management."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Pheasant hunting is a statewide tradition with statewide economic impact, so maintaining and growing the industry requires statewide involvement. This means we’re going to get aggressive on predator control with a bounty program. Young people will have a chance to get out there and help reduce the threats to our pheasant population. This also means the funding for improved habitat must come from an increase in private and foundation dollars as well. I’ll make the ask directly if needed. I’d love to see banquets and fundraisers and employer-match programs all making habitat one of their causes."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I’m sure there are other great ideas out there when it comes to habitat that we haven’t thought of yet. That’s why we’re going to crowd source habitat solutions. Taking advantage of online capabilities, my administration will expand the capabilities at habitat.sd.gov to ensure every South Dakotan, not just those on assigned advisory boards or in Pierre, can directly contribute to the policymaking process. Should your ideas be implemented, I’d like to see the commission waive your hunting license fees for that year."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Of course, work at the national level can’t stop either. I’m committed to keeping habitat management as a national priority. As a top negotiator of the 2014 Farm Bill, I fought to enhance CRP, and when the Obama administration accepted just 101 acres into CRP in South Dakota in 2016, I fought back. I will take up that same cause as Governor. Working in partnership with groups like Pheasants Forever, I will leverage the relationships I have around the country to win over CRP and habitat advocates in Congress, the administration, and Governors’ Associations. This broad base of support is essential in not only maintaining federal programs but making sure everyone knows that if you want to hunt pheasants, you’d better book your trip to South Dakota. We’ll do what we need to do in here to keep on harvesting a million roosters each fall for generations to come. Consider me our Sportsman in Chief for South Dakota Pheasant Hunting."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As we look to the next generation, few things are as important as kickstarting our economy. We owe it to our kids to create and sustain an economy that is not only strong, but diversified. We owe it to our kids to give them an economy that offers reasons to stay in South Dakota after graduation or to return and raise their families. We owe it to ourselves to encourage growth and development in all communities, large and small. We are, after all, only as strong as our weakest community."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"And while we do a lot of things right in South Dakota, our economy has fallen behind in recent years. The economy in Indian Country needs focus as well. There are many challenges today for tribes, but I am looking to build relationships and partnerships with them in many areas: education, law and order, and economic development."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This kickstart begins by lifting government burdens from small businesses owners and making it easier to work and create new opportunities that allow South Dakotans to prosper. By expanding on the strong business climate we have built through a low-tax, low-regulation environment, we’ll give businesses room to grow. If you think a state’s regulatory or tax burden doesn’t matter to business, think again. Just last week, Minnesota start-up aquaculture company trū Shrimp announced plans to move its first planned production facility, a major investment, from the site it previously chose in Luverne, Minnesota, to a new site in Madison, South Dakota. I want to hear stories like this every week, and I believe that’s possible. There’s a reason we’re considered one of the best places to operate a business. It’s imperative we keep it that way."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I believe continuing this pro-business approach and stable government will make South Dakota a destination of choice in coming years. When other states raise taxes to bail themselves out and refuse to offer regulatory relief, we’ll be here ready. Now is the time to begin the search for the “Next Big Thing” for South Dakota."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As many of you know, in the early 1980’s, Governor Janklow had the foresight to identify and to target the credit card industry as an area in which South Dakota could compete and win at a national level. We changed our approach to regulating that industry, ushering in a tremendous expansion of not only credit card processing, but our financial services sector more generally. We created thousands of good jobs. Today, South Dakota is home to $3.1 trillion in bank assets – more than any other state in the country. Our trust industry oversees billions more, providing still more South Dakotans with reliable, high-paying jobs."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,If bringing in the financial services industry was the last “Big Thing” then it’s time to start looking for the “Next Big Thing.” Because we can’t stop moving forward. We must look ahead to the emerging opportunities that can power growth for the next generation.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"That is why I am charging my Office of Economic Development with not only identifying our next generation of targeted industries, but also marketing to attract the most innovative companies in those sectors. Over the next six weeks, GOED will develop and roll out a new, more user-friendly website that is more responsive to the needs of existing South Dakota businesses and those interested in moving here."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Our state should continue drawing on our traditional strength as an agricultural state by seeking out more value-added processing opportunities. We have been successful in attracting dairy processing and growing the dairy herd, but we still send far too much of our corn, soybeans, and livestock out of state for consumption or processing. It leaves our farmers vulnerable to the effects of tariffs and basis. Enhancing outlets within South Dakota will benefit farmers and enhance the strength of our small communities, and I have challenged GOED to make this area a priority."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Second, we must leverage our expertise in agriculture along with our growing capacity in human health research. Whether it’s new therapies for human diseases, new crop technologies, or other applied research, South Dakota has a valuable contribution to make as a place for innovation in this area and in turn we’re gaining international recognition."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Third, we have an opportunity to capitalize on a world-class talent pipeline and our strong tradition of service to become a leader in the cybersecurity. The success of DSU’s cybersecurity program has brought South Dakota national attention. DSU is poised to supply the financial services industry, military, and intelligence community, among others, with a workforce that will lead this new and rapidly growing industry. Our priority must be not only in training this workforce, but also in attracting or creating companies in South Dakota to keep our graduates here, at home, with great jobs and a way of life they love."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"In the Black Hills, the U.S. Air Force’s rollout of the next-generation B-21 Raider bomber will also bring with it a surge of activity in and around Ellsworth Air Force base. This growth will open up new opportunities for good jobs, provide a platform for attracting additional military-connected businesses, and increase Ellsworth’s already substantial $300 million annual impact on our economy. Ensuring Box Elder, Rapid City, and the Black Hills region are equipped to capitalize on Ellsworth’s rapid expansion must be a priority for us all."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Identifying and securing South Dakota’s Next Big Thing, while better supporting our existing businesses, is a challenge, but I can’t think of anything more important to our next generation than kickstarting our economy. So many of our other challenges – drugs, family, resources for schools and building community – become easier when our citizens are prospering and our economy is growing. Done well, we will build an economy to take South Dakota to the next generation and beyond."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Creating new jobs, new industries and new economic horizons for our state will be worthless if we don’t have the next generation of South Dakotans educated, trained and ready to take on these new opportunities and challenges."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As I tour our state’s businesses and meet with employers, what I have heard from them is encouraging. Outside of ag, business is good and they’d like to expand. Again and again, though, I heard the same challenge that is holding them back: workforce shortages."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As governor, I want to break down barriers to help fill these shortages. In our smaller communities and more rural areas, one common barrier is affordable housing. Today I’m announcing a pilot project by the South Dakota Housing Development Authority to help fix this problem. We will be building new modular multi-housing units, called DakotaPlex, at the state prison facility in Springfield. It will be similar to the Governor’s Houses, but built as duplex, triplex, or quadriplex units. South Dakota communities of less than 5000 people will be eligible to purchase these units and offer them for rent at affordable levels. I’m confident this new project will help our smaller communities expand housing options for workers."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Another state-imposed barrier to workforce can be professional licensure. I am directing the Department of Labor and Regulation, over the next year, to work with our professional organizations and licensure boards to conduct a full review of licensing requirements. We need to consider the elimination of unnecessary licenses, opportunities to streamline the licensure process, and options to fast-track licenses for apprentices, in-state graduates, veterans, and military personnel and their families. We can’t let unneeded red tape get in the way of growth."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"These are both important steps, but they are only a start. Workforce is a national problem. Recently, because of the strength of the national economy, the United States reached an important milestone: there are actually more job openings today than there are unemployed people actively seeking to fill them."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"In South Dakota, according to our most recent data, we have 15,870 job openings and 13,600 people actively looking for work. Unfortunately, we have a skills gap – those unemployed workers don’t have the skills necessary to fill the open jobs."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We have already taken steps in South Dakota to address this skills gap. We should all be very proud of our state’s technical institutes. Near my home town, Lake Area Tech was recognized just two years ago as the best two-year college in America. All four of our technical institutes have new facilities, new equipment, and qualified faculty offering cutting-edge programs. The Build Dakota scholarship has made it easier for hundreds of young people to get job training, and then stay in South Dakota to work in high-need fields."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We can also be proud of our university system, which prepares more young people for their careers than any other set of institutions. I am concerned, though, that the priorities of our employers and our educators sometimes do not fully align. That can leave some young people with limited job prospects. My team will help me bring together employers, K-12 educators, the Regents, and the Technical Institutes. We need to do more to provide career counseling and information for students, starting in middle school."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I strongly believe that the best way to prepare our young people for their careers is through work experience. Growing up on the farm, we all worked. We didn’t know any other way. There was no Facebook or Instagram, so I didn’t know what my classmates were doing after school or in the summers. I just knew that my siblings and I were expected to work hard. I’m glad we did – that early experience taught me lessons that have served me well in my life."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Over the coming year, I’m asking school leaders to work with me to dramatically increase work experience in our high schools. We need more CTE and skills training in high school. We need more apprenticeship programs. And we need more opportunities for young people to get out of the classroom and experience a real job."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,I would like our high schools to join together each year to hold a “Week of Work.” This will be a special week when every high school student will get out of the classroom to experience a day on the job. I hope this can lead to schools coordinating more internships and experience-based classes.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Learning about the world of work helps our young people to figure out what fields aren’t for them and eventually they’ll hopefully find something they love. Perhaps more importantly, though, work experience teaches young people the soft skills they need. Work experience teaches young people to show up on time, to dress professionally, and to interact with customers. We do a disservice to our students if they graduate high school without these skills."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Some of you may know that, when I started college, I considered becoming a teacher. My dad’s accident changed my plans, but education remains a priority for me. One of my aspirations as governor is improve our educational opportunities and performance so that our kids can have greater success."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We need to do more to empower families. Every child has different needs and talents, and we all know that family involvement gets better results. The All-City Elementary School in Sioux Falls is an example of this and a model for others to emulate. One of its core tenants and requirements is a high level of parent involvement. The results are clear. Its students perform at much higher levels than the average elementary school both in the Sioux Falls school district and statewide."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Empowering families also means supporting each family’s decisions for education. I am a proud product of public school and so are my kids, but South Dakota also has excellent private schools, and many dedicated home school families. This year, I will be bringing legislation to remove an unnecessary testing requirement that state law currently imposes on home school families. I will also be supporting legislation to make home school students eligible, on an equal basis, for the South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"And we do have abundant opportunity in our state, but too often our students don’t understand how blessed they are to live in a land of opportunity. I believe the next generation of South Dakotans must understand the foundations of our nation, the tremendous sacrifices made to protect our constitutional rights, and the freedoms, liberties, and responsibilities we have as citizens."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"In this Capitol is a statue of one of South Dakota’s early leaders, General William Henry Harrison Beadle. He was a Civil War veteran and he took his civic role seriously. General Beadle once said that the purpose of education is to prepare “also for all civic and social duties. Not for wage earning alone, not for money making alone, must we educate.”"
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Civics need to reemerge. From grade school to the universities. Interim Secretary Jones is a professor of history and he will be key to this effort. This year, as a first step, I will be bringing legislation to require that every high school graduate be able to pass the United States citizenship exam. This is the test that we ask immigrants to take before they become U.S. Citizens. It is only fair that, before our young people graduate from high school and take on their responsibilities as citizens, they also display this basic knowledge of our nation’s institutions and its history. If our next generation is to be successful, they must know the story of our past generations."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"You all know when we invest in our kids, we’re investing in our future. Our future is only as strong as our kids. Which is why it’s vital we address problems when they threaten to dismantle the success of the next generation."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As I mentioned earlier, over the past several weeks, my team and I have received briefings from every cabinet department. One issue I heard, time and again, from many departments is the impact of the meth epidemic on our state. Opioids make the national news and they are a problem in South Dakota, but our overwhelming problem is meth."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"A couple months ago, I spoke with a first-responder in one of our cities who told me of situations where they walk into homes of meth users and find kids starving in their bedrooms, their parents drugged out of their minds, incompetent of caring for their children. Stories like this are frequent. In our neighboring state of Iowa, a four-month-old baby was killed just over a month ago after his meth-addict dad forgot him in a swing. He died of malnutrition and infection. The police found his little body covered in maggots and sores – his parents too strung out on meth to remember his existence."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This is what our law enforcement has to deal with every day. Can you even imagine? Meth is filling our jails and prisons, clogging our court systems, and stretching our drug treatment capacity. But meth is rarely made in South Dakota anymore, the vast majority of this meth is coming from Mexico. Our meth epidemic is the price we are paying for our nation’s failure to adequately secure our southern border."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"To give you a sense of the scale of the problem in South Dakota: In 2011, there were 402 meth arrests in South Dakota. Those arrests led to the seizure of approximately 4,300 grams of meth. Look ahead seven years to 2018. We have gone from 402 arrests to 3,366 – and that doesn’t even include December of 2018. The amount of meth seized in these arrests has increased from approximately 4,300 grams to nearly 40,000 grams. A nearly tenfold increase."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Some of that increase is due to better enforcement, and that is a good thing. We’re catching more bad guys. But we all understand that the meth epidemic is only getting worse."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Meth destroys people, but it does much more. It destroys families. It hurts our kids, and we see that in our schools, in our foster families, and in our health care providers."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Every child deserves to grow up in a good home with parents who love them, and when I see a child who has lost her family to meth, it breaks my heart. Not because I am the governor. Because I am a mom."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We cannot allow meth to break apart our families, consume our resources, and destroy our state. I will not stand for it. Some of us want to look away. We want to flip the channel when we hear about stories like the child in the swing. Some of us might think meth is something that other communities are dealing with or other types of people that you don’t associate with. We can’t do that. We can’t look away. We have to stare down meth."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"There are no easy answers to this issue. I know we have tried to address these problems. But we need to do more. And we need to focus on three key areas: education, enforcement, and treatment."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"So today, I am proposing that we expand prevention and treatment programs. We need to do more to educate our young people about the effects of meth and give them strategies to avoid it. In the past these efforts have relied on grant funding, but I will be asking for dedicated general funds to carry a strong and consistent message, especially to our young people. Before the legislative session is over, there will be a plan on my desk that will help our state stare down the meth problem. The plan must include tools to improve education, enforcement and treatment."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,We will help every South Dakotan learn to identify the early signs of meth use to increase early referrals to treatment. Early intervention is the first defense against this problem. I want to reach meth users before they enter the criminal justice system and commit other crimes. Our objective isn’t to imprison people – that hurts families too. W e need additional mental health services for this issue and many others. Our ideal is to help people beat their meth addiction and return to their jobs and families.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"At the same time, I am proposing that we become much more aggressive in enforcing our laws against meth. We need to stop the traffic of meth into our state, and crack down on those who deal meth and other drugs. I am confident that every dollar we spend to keep meth out will be repaid many times."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"And while we crack down on enforcement, we must pave avenues for rehabilitation. Earlier this year, I visited Teen Challenge in Brookings – an incredible program that helps people struggling with life-controlling substance abuse and equips them to become productive members of their community. We need more options for people trapped in addiction, recognizing that second chances are available to people willing to walk the road to recovery."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Now for a moment I would like to turn your attention to another important issue impacting families in our state. As I just described, because of meth, dozens of kids are separated from their homes every week, sending child after child into the foster system. While meth isn’t the only reason for broken families in South Dakota, the children in our foster system need to be in a home. Every child deserves a home."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Most of us just finished up spending the holidays with our families and friends. We ate together, gave each other gifts and shared stories and laughter. But this Christmas, 192 children were in our foster care system available and waiting for adoptive families. In total, 940 children were in foster care. They didn’t have their family to spend their Christmas with. They didn’t have a family to laugh and celebrate with. And while the staff at the Department of Social Services can raise awareness about the need, get the facts out, and debunk some of the myths people may believe, they can’t just create families for these kids. They can’t put children in a home if no one is willing to provide one. And they can’t get the word out if people aren’t listening."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"That is why, today, I am committing to use my podium, my microphone, and my influence to educate our state about the need for more foster parents. In every formal speech I give, I’m going to talk about it. You’re going to get tired of hearing me talk about it. So if you are a foster parent and you have a positive experience to share, send it in to my office. We will use the information with discretion, but we need to tell your stories. We need more parents, more families, more South Dakotans to raise their hands and say, “yes, I’ll be a foster parent. I agree, every child deserves a home.”"
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"The state has a website - fosterone.sd.gov - where you can learn more, ask questions, and start the process to become a foster family. We’ll be updating the website over the next year. And I’ll be talking about it. A lot. It’s seems almost too obvious to this say out loud, but I will just to be clear – the next generation of South Dakotans will not thrive if they don’t have a home. A place to grow up. A family to love them."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Agriculture is the foundation of South Dakota's economy and our number one industry – by a significant margin. All in all, it contributes about $25.6 billion to the economy, so when ag prospers, South Dakota prospers. Of course, when droughts hit or markets slide, everyone feels that too."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"It’s been a tough few years for ag in South Dakota, and I’ve worked hard to put proper safety nets in place for unexpected circumstances like what we’ve experienced. You see, without certainty, farmers aren’t able to do what they do best: feed the world."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"As a lifelong farmer and rancher, I know the challenges that come with the business. I know the stress that comes when you take out loans, bury that money in the ground in the form of seed and fertilizer, and hope not only for a good yield, but for the right market conditions at the right time. It’s a tough business. But I understand why folks do it. It’s a special job to feed the world – to know that the product of your labor brings families together around a dinner table, to know that your work makes a real difference."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"So as governor, I’ll utilize my experience as a lifelong producer to advance agriculture in our state. From protecting property rights to expanding markets, my administration is being built to develop the state’s agricultural economy and give more young people the opportunity to thrive as farmers and ranchers in South Dakota."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This year, we will focus on growth in the ag economy by transferring Ag Development Representatives from the Department of Agriculture to my office of economic development. This makes sense, because ag development is economic development."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"For years, these two departments have largely performed the same functions when it comes to ag development. This move will consolidate resources and brainpower, supply more tools for development, eliminate red tape, and create a better approach to developing our largest industry and create a lasting infrastructure for the next generation."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I might not be traveling to DC every week anymore, and believe me, I’m good with that, but I will continue leveraging my federal network – from the President on down – and partner with our South Dakota delegation to continue pushing for a level playing field when it comes to trade. Farmers want trade, not aid. Producers don’t want federal bailouts. We crave expanded market opportunities. And I believe we’ll get there with this Administration."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This has been a frequent conversation I’ve had with President Trump – as recently as a few weeks ago – and I’m grateful for the outcomes we’ve seen as a result. Late last year, I was glad to see the president’s support of farm country when he lifted restrictions on year-round E15, a move that will help consume another 2 billion bushels of corn, while potentially saving consumers up to 10 cents per gallon at the pump."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"We’ll begin the process of transitioning the state vehicle fleet to E30, further maximizing the use of homegrown fuels and revolutionizing the way we fuel both our vehicles and our economy. I’ve already met with state government leaders on this initiative and we’re working on a plan."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"It’s critical we keep communicating the impact of decisions like this to the president, because quite frankly, most of Washington isn’t talking about agriculture. Fifty years ago, there were more than 200 rural congressional districts in the House of Representatives. Now, just over 30 remain. I’m grateful South Dakota has strong voices for ag in Senator John Thune, Senator Mike Rounds, and Representative Dusty Johnson. I will do everything I can to continue leveraging my experience to expand trade and keep ag strong."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"And I’d be remiss to talk about this new Administration's approach to ag without mentioning Kim Vanneman, who’ll be serve as my secretary of agriculture. Kim is very different from any ag secretary South Dakota has ever had. She truly brings a new perspective to the table. I’m grateful for the ways she has been an ag leader in our state – on the farm, in the legislature, in the board room and as a mom passing along her love of agriculture to her kids. She’s going to make a great Ag Secretary. Thank you for serving, Kim."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I’m proud of our agriculture tradition in South Dakota. Our ag industry is special – it’s our legacy, our way of life. We must do everything we can to ensure the ag economy is ready to support the next generation of farmers and ranchers."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,Making Government More Transparent
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"The issue of government transparency might be last among my major policy items mentioned here today but that’s because it’s a cornerstone. As we build up, every other item must align with transparency. Many Americans and many South Dakotans are losing their trust in government. This is particularly true of the younger generations. Stories of government ineptitude and downright scandal don’t help matters much. I hear you. I’m with you."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"So today, I’m committing to work toward building the most transparent administration South Dakota has ever seen. I’ll bring debates and meetings from the boardroom to your living room by utilizing free technologies like YouTube, Facebook Live and other apps. We’ll modernize and expand existing transparency websites by adding all agendas, minutes, and livestreams to a centralized online location. If my cabinet secretaries and other administration leaders don’t stay on top of this, I’m going to make them donate to our pheasant habitat funds."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Fact-based reporting must be valued and encouraged in order to uphold the integrity of government entities. To that end, I want to see a commonsense Reporter Shield law, protecting the constitutional right to a free and independent press. I want that bill on my desk before the end of session."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Our state government must operate to serve people, not special interests. If you have other ideas for ways to increase transparency, send them in to us. We’ll work to bring more sunlight to the statehouse. You have my word."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Now, none of us would live in this wonderful country today if it weren’t for our military and our law enforcement officers."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"The South Dakota National Guard continues to support federal commitments worldwide with nearly 150 Soldiers and Airmen deployed in support of overseas operations in Iraq, Kuwait, Quatar, the UAE, and Poland. The Guard is also supporting federal commitments here at home. Seven Soldiers are supporting cyber defense operations in the National Capitol Region. And just yesterday I approved a four-Soldier aviation crew, with a UH-72 helicopter, to deploy this week to Arizona in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection security operations along the Southwest border. We must do what we can to help secure the southern border."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"Here in South Dakota, I have big plans for Hot Springs and how we can better care for, and recognize veterans at the facilities in that town. Big plans. Our veterans have served us. It is our solemn duty to serve them."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"I am sure that there will be issues that arise during my tenure as governor that will require the strength and resolve of our first responders, our military and our law enforcement. I know that they will be up to the task. I know that they are training and preparing right now, even today, for the unexpected as well as the expected."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"One of those issues that we do expect, is the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline through South Dakota. Let me be very clear on this: I want the construction of this pipeline to be safe, clean and efficient. We will make sure that people, water and the environment are protected. My administration will work with the tribes, the companies, and as necessary, law enforcement, to make this as uneventful as possible."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,I want to thank you all for your time and attention today. Serving as our state’s 33rd governor is an immense honor and I look forward to it. I pray for the strength and wisdom to govern effectively. God will be faithful in guiding us and giving us the strength to persevere.
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"This is the end of this yearly address, but it is not the end of the conversation around these issues. I look forward to taking these policies, these ideas, these discussions around the state. I want to hear from you. So please, invite me to your local civic organization and community meetings, or even your morning coffee group."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,"In closing, I want to take a moment to thank my family. Thank you for your support and your help, and your energy. The reason I got involved in public service was to make South Dakota a better place – a better place to do business and raise a family. One of the reasons I care about these issues is because I wanted those things for my family, and every other family. I know that’s why you serve as well. So I look forward to working with South Dakota leaders, in governments and in the private sector, to improve our state for today. And for the next generation."
North Dakota,Doug Burgum,Republican,Thank you. And may God bless South Dakota.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Well, I want to thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and thanks to all the members of the General Assembly for bringing this joint legislative session to Sandusky and the shores of, of course, our great lake."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"For the people of the city that's about to celebrate 200 years of history with their bicentennial in 2018, I hope this session and all the events surrounding our visit here will go down as one more historic event for Sandusky to be remembered for years to come. We love being here."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"With that in mind, I want to give special thanks to the people of Sandusky and Erie County, local officials, law enforcement, the community leaders - had a beautiful visit at the Boys & Girls Club today, that was great -- who've laid out the red carpet for us."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And, of course, to our hosts here at the historic State Theatre. Everybody would say, ""wow"" to this theater. For those who don't live here, how about a round of applause for what they have here."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I hope you'll welcome our Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor. Mary, stand and give a wave, will you?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And the members of my Cabinet and staff who are with us this evening, they've been out, about in the community all day. And one of the traditions of the State of the State is for the Cabinet to get out and listen and learn about the things that we can do to help. Would the Cabinet just stand for a second and recognize a little applause from the people that are here tonight?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I have to tell you, I've been in love with Ohio's north coast and this part of the state for a long, long time. You see, when I was a kid, my mom and dad used to pack up the car and we would drive up to Vermilion, not far from here. We'd leave...."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"There we go. We'd leave Pittsburgh and we'd drive. Some of you heard me say this before. We would cross into Ohio. And my uncle Harry who was always with us, he'd turn to me and look at me and he'd say, ""Johnny, we've reached the promised land."" That's how I thought about Ohio."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I have so many good memories of summers here on the lake. Of course, this region continues to generate good memories for hundreds of thousands who come here for the recreation, the resources, and the hospitality Lake Erie coast is known for. And Sandusky is at the heart of it. I want you to know that I detoured today -- maybe even broke a law -- but I went over to Cedar Point to look at the rollers coasters. I want you all to know that."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And we're investing a lot in our lake -- Randy Gardner is always on top of that - and our coastal resources to make the water cleaner and keep it that way. About two and half billion dollars have been invested in Lake Erie since the start of the Administration. Yes, we want to make it cleaner, and we aim to keep it clean. And I hope those that come after me will realize this is the great, great jewel of the state of Ohio, and that's the great Lake Erie."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We also gave a $1 million grant that we announced here yesterday to the city so they could work to restore wetlands in the Sandusky Bay that filter pollutants, and they make Lake Erie cleaner. I hope you like that."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"These are investments in water and natural resources, the quality of life, but of course they're also an investment in economic growth because we know that when we take care of the world around us it becomes another reason for job creators to want to put down roots here and want to grow."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"As I've said many times before throughout my career, our greatest moral purpose as governmental leaders is to create an environment of job creation in which people can have work, in which people can support their families. And I can think back just a short six and a half years ago, and some of you, you know: Bill Batchelder who's here on the video, Tom Niehaus, Keith Faber, who sits out here, these were the leaders, Cliff and Larry. We'd lost 350,000 jobs. That's, you know, like -- that's filling Ohio Stadium, you know, three, four -- three times, plus. We had an $8 billion deficit, and I went to New York to the rating agencies and they said, ""We're going to tear up your credit cards."" I said, ""Give us a chance."""
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, this is old news to many of you, but I'm saying it again because we do have members of the legislature here who never went through that experience. And you remember that experience. It was tough. It was trying, and we came out stronger. Now we are up 460,000 new jobs in our state."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And we're working to create a more diversified economy. Why? So that when one sector goes down in a tough economic time, another sector can lift us up. It's called diversification, and we really do believe in it. Now, manufacturing and agriculture, of course, they matter. They're two cornerstones of our state, but they're changing as well. Look at the auto industry. Engines and transmissions are more powerful, durable, and efficient -- more efficient than ever. And we'll talk about autonomous vehicles in a moment. In aviation, breakthroughs are making jet engines quieter and cost less to operate, and think about GE down in Cincinnati making those engines. It's pretty awesome."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And in agriculture, you all know up here farmers are using the latest research so food scientists can meet the demands of a growing population around the world. The world's job creators know that we in Ohio make things. That's why they're turning to us for their future success and they're using new technologies and innovations that dramatically change the way that products are made."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Just down the road in Norwalk, the German auto parts maker Borgers has spent $60 million on a new state-of-the-art plant that will create jobs for more than 230 workers, earning $8 million in payroll. And near Dayton, the giant Chinese auto glassmaker Fuyao transformed an abandoned car factory. The auto company left. It was an old factory. And now Fuyao has gone in and transformed that operation and they now employ more than 2,000 Ohioans, who supply all the major automakers with advanced glass. This is great news for us."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And you know Amazon: Amazon Prime, Amazon Now, Amazon cloud computing. It's just amazing. They're an amazing innovator, combining highly trained workers and best-in-class processes, and they're turning retailing inside-out. They have three cloud computing operations in the United States, three operations in the whole country. They've got one on the West Coast out in Seattle, one on the East Coast in Virginia, and the third one is located right here in the good old state of Ohio. A major cloud-computing operation."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,And our universities are now beginning to train people; our community colleges are training people for those cloud-computing jobs.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, here's what's really astounding that I'm sure most don't know. Amazon Now has hired 6,000 Ohioans to work in their operations, and we believe with more to come. That's looking towards the future. We have Explorys. Explorys is a fast-growing leader in the health data analytics field. Data analytics: we study stuff and we know what works. You get knee surgery, we know if you get a shot in that knee, you'll heal faster than if you don't. They use data to figure out the ways in which to best treat people. It was a start-up operation at the Cleveland Clinic and was purchased by IBM Watson. Here's the beauty of it. Instead of IBM Watson trying to move this operation out of Ohio, they're planning it right here. They're not going anywhere. They like what they see in Ohio."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"There's Cardinal Commerce, a leader in financial technology and digital commerce that just opened a new headquarters in Mentor. And Interstate Chemical, which is investing more than 50 million in a new plant in the city the Oregon, not too far west of here. I don't know if anybody's here from there."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And Alkermes, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and what they're doing is growing its business right where Cliff is from, the speaker, and what they're doing is developing products to battle addiction worldwide."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"These job creation stories and more like them demonstrate the way our state, with JobsOhio's support, is attracting businesses of the 21st century from a range of different industries."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, think about it. Not just agriculture, not just making things, but it's across the board. That's what's given strength and resilience to our state."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"How did we do it? Folks, some of it can be viewed as boring. We had to stabilize our budget within existing resources. You see, we reassured job creators that Ohio knows how to fix problems itself. We don't need to go and impose anything on them. We can deal with our problems. We cut income taxes. We eliminated income taxes for almost every small business in the state. They're the engines of job growth."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And, Keith Faber, I want to thank you for that. Eliminating the taxes on small business helps them all, just like the place where I had some great fish right here in Sandusky earlier today. We want them to have a power to expand."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We streamlined regulations, committed ourselves to constantly improving job training, which is a big, big deal. So job creators can have the workforce they need and Ohioans can take advantage of all the new opportunities coming our way."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, look, people think: the State of the State, you just get up and say things -- falsehoods and you just puff yourself up. That's not my purpose here tonight. I'm really here tonight to talk about where we were, where we've gained, and where we're going. Last fall, a survey of CEOs named Ohio one of the ten best places to do business. Last fall. That's 34 places higher than we ranked in 2010. So when they start looking around the country about where we're going to create a business, we went from 34th to one of the top ten businesses."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Forbes ranked us the 11th best state for business. That's up from 38th. So we went from 11th with Forbes, from 38th just five years ago. And there have been other good ratings, like the one from middle market executives - that's sort of middle-sized companies -- that placed us first in growth in the country. And this is all great, of course, but we can't stop now."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The Midwest is ripe for investment. It's ripe for development. It's ripe for growth. And Ohio is at the center of it. The only thing that can hold us back is if we sit on our hands or stop and rest. I heard somebody talking: ""Oh, you know, so much has been done. Can't we take a break? Can't we slow down?"" Yeah, if you want to lose. We cannot slow down. This is the 21st century. We've got to put our foot on the gas. And I can guarantee you because I know other states see our success, and they want it. So staying on the right track means keeping up the same energy that got us here and building on the ideas that we know work. Conservative budgeting, even in these tight times. More tax reform. More work to streamline regs, more progress on connecting education and our workforce training with job creators. Get them trained for what's coming. These are all critical to our future success. And, of course, our budget really reflects things on every one of these fronts."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, folks, we have to protect our hard-fought fiscal stability again. It's priority number one in the budget. I used to be a legislator. I know there are a lot of demands and a lot of needs. But, you know, if we do not hold the line on spending, I will tell you that we'll get crushed economically."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And I'll tell you something. I appreciate what all of you have done. I deeply appreciate it. I mean, I can't tell you how much. I'm not running for anything. Okay? I'm just thanking you as the executive of this state, because what I know is that when the state revenue fell below what we'd already projected because we had conservative projections, we didn't go in the hole. Do you know how many states have been in the hole? Do you know how many states that have had a cut? And it has not been easy, but we're managing."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I work with Larry and I work with Cliff, and we have kept spending in check. It's a reminder that challenges can always lurk around the corner. So we have to always hold the line on spending. That's more true in this budget than it's really been in a number of years. The revenues have grown slowly, even though we have conservative projections."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The way that we respond to these challenges, of course, it shows the world that we can take it, that we can navigate rough waters. And it's a beacon. It's a beacon. When we can do our job and keep it together and do the right thing, people around the country -- and believe me, I was just in Europe -- around the world, they say: ""you folks have it."" We like what you're doing."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"A lot of you ask, ""Okay, Kasich, you know, we never get thanked when we reduce the income tax. Now you want to reform the tax code and you want to have some go up and the income tax go down. Why?"" Well, I'll tell you why. You look at the states across this country that have the fastest economic growth. They either have no income tax or very low income taxes. It matters. It matters to what people are going to pay."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So we're never going to be as competitive as we need to be if we don't keep paying attention to this, but we can. But we also need to reform our convoluted municipal tax system. Our tax department estimates that job creators could save $800 million if, in fact, we can reform this municipal tax system. That's $800 million that can be put back into those companies to grow and to hire."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And by the way, it adds nicely to 5 billion in tax cuts that we've had in our legislature during this administration. That's more than any state in the country. More than any state in the country. And, then, you know what? We also cut the Workers Comps and made refunds to businesses across the state and schools and local governments: $5 billion. I mean, it's amazing, you know?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I don't want anybody coming and complaining, but when I was running, that's all they talked about, how bad the Workers' Comp system was. Now we've been able to rebate 5 billion, and I've got a sneaky suspicion that the Workers' Comp Board is going to pass another billion in rebates, some of which is going to go to local governments and schools in tough times. And it's a great story for our state."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We want to know what you think. You know, we've got a budget over there. You've got ideas. They're better ideas than we have, we're for it. But let's please get this municipal tax burden passed so we can, in fact, help these businesses."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The barrier to these reforms and many of the others we achieved together in the past seven years at the age-old fear of change. In a rapidly changing economic environment, in the digital age, in the age of worldwide markets, we can't do what we used to do. We have to anticipate and meet change head on because if we hesitate, the future will pass us by. And we must leverage change to our advantage, and that means takings risks."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"When we think about Ohio and our success in the previous century, wasn't it because we were risk takers. Think about it. It's why we are, who we are today. We were at the center of the Industrial Revolution, because so many dove headfirst into new ideas,"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Think about this, the Industrial Revolution, new ideas about what to make and how to make it. And they accepted no limits on how they could go. It was all about risk taking, and we don't need to go any further than just down the road, because I just saw that Thomas Edison freeway, Milan -- perfect example of what we're talking about. Thomas Edison. He was our guy. He wasn't just a brilliant and creative innovator -- the guy took risks. He never gave up. He put everything he had on the line. Well, what do you think Edison would be working on today? Think about it. How about the Wright brothers? You know all that Kitty Hawk nonsense. All they had was wind and sand. Okay?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"All the innovation occurred in Dayton, Ohio. Those Wright brothers were great."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And they tell me, you know, you should all read the book about the Wright brothers by David McCullough. Nobody paid any attention to them. They're down in Dayton flying airplanes. My mother said when she was a little girl they'd run out of the house to look at airplanes. The guy from the Dayton Daily News told me when they went out and saw it, they put it on page 13. Must not have been bad news. Think about the Wright brothers and Edison. Look, folks, you learn from history. They launched entirely new industries. It was unbelievable."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,And their inventions and innovative technologies led to new jobs and prosperity for generations. And not just in America. All over the globe.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The new Edisons and Wright brothers, they're out there. Some of them might be right here tonight. And we need to find them and encourage them. That's why I've proposed creating a chief innovative officer for Ohio to help keep us ahead of the curve in a world where technology is changing faster and more profoundly than ever. This person will lead a new Ohio Institute of Technology. We're not expanding the government, we can rearrange it and make things work better. That person will mine our strengths, coordinate our resources, and always looking ahead to what's coming next. Whether it's advanced materials, the latest in biotechnology, aerospace, robotics, sensors, and others areas that we haven't even thought about. We have a lot of research in Ohio. It's not coordinated, it's not put together, it's not focused. We have such a great opportunity to create new things here in the 21st Century. If we come up with these ideas, they can change our world in the very new future."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Let me tell you about cars. Cars are going to look very different inside. Just buckle up. You won't touch the controls because there isn't going to be a steering wheel or any pedals. Do you know this is coming? This is within a decade. Traffic deaths will fall dramatically if not disappear. You know why? No more drunk driving, distracted driving. We may decide not to own our own cars since we'll be able to order them up on demand whenever we need one. We will only drive our car ten percent of the time. Think about. You don't drive your car all the time. So you drive your car. It's fully autonomous. Somebody wants to rent your car. You send the fully autonomous vehicle to them. They pay for renting your vehicle, which you use to pay your car bills. And at the end when they're done, they send the car back and you go home. This is coming. I mean, this is just amazing and exciting."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"One of the places that we won't visit as often: the grocery store. You know, now you go to Amazon - right now - their delivering things from the grocery store, but drones are going to be delivering our groceries and maybe even a hot fresh pizza right to our door steps. Anybody ever seen the Jetsons?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"But let me also tell you, drones are going to help our farmers better manage their crops. Am I right, farmers? You're going to get out in that field and figure out how to fertilize and manage your crops better because of drones."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Firefighters, they're going to be able to more safely battle fires. And ODOT inspectors that hang off these bridges won't have to do it anymore. They'll have an assist from a drone to allow them to do what they need to do without putting themselves in danger. And that's just the beginning of drones."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Big data will lead us to better healthcare - like at the Cleveland Clinic. They find out what works and what doesn't. It's almost like personalized medicine. It is so cool because you don't have to waste time and keep coming back. Think about the Cleveland Clinic, think about technology. That's what big data is all about. Using big data will help us unlock the answers to things like infant mortality. Why does it happen? Drug addiction. What is the pattern that leads people into using drugs? We can even use big data to tackle education challenges. We can understand what triggers dropouts. Why do we have truancy? Why do we have reading problems? I'm over there at that Boys and Girls Club and I'm looking at those people - and I have big dreams for them. Maybe we can help them if we can figure out to keep them on the right path, by looking at facts and figures and data and patterns."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Advanced sensors also hold great promise. We're already using them. For some with disabilities, the basic act of taking a morning shower - you have somebody who's autistic that's in a group home - if they don't get a shower in the morning, you ask John Martin, he's one of the great, great people in our Cabinet. He runs the Department of Developmental Disabilities."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Here's what we do. He takes these sensors and they put them in the showerhead. When the shower doesn't come on in the morning, the caregivers and the family hear. And they go and they make sure that the person living in that group home is okay."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We had a lady who was living in a home. It cost us $147,000 a year to watch her because she used to run off. We didn't know why. John Martin, he figured out, let's put some technology in this place, and he did. And when the woman has trouble, either through a sensor or some video, we find out about it. She doesn't run away anymore. We've reduced the cost of taking care of that woman from $147,000 down to $47,000. There's no limit to what we can do."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, folks, when I talk to my friends in the technology area - and I know a lot of them - they marvel about what's coming. I talk to them about it all the time. But they also caution about the dramatic impact all of this will have on today's industries and workers."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I was in Europe. I went over to the Munich conference, but then I met with people like the Siemens CEO who's an investor in our state. I met with companies there and in London. I heard the same things from business leaders all across Europe. The message was the same and clear. Please listen to me. The dramatic change is coming."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Assembly lines and their workers will see even more changes from robotics. You know the number one occupation in America is a driver. What do you think is going to happen when we're confronted by the reality of self-driving trucks? The entire automobile supply chain workforce will face changes from internal combustion to the electric motor. Folks, this is coming."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Make no mistake, this change will affect not just blue-collar jobs. Insurance adjusters, stockbrokers, they may be impacted by artificial intelligence. Who knows, maybe in the General Assembly we'll be replaced by robots. You just never know."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,And maybe the governor as well.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The bottom line for almost everybody in almost every profession is this. Mothers and fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers, please, brothers and sisters, legislators, if we aren't prepared for change, people are going to find themselves out of work. Change is coming, whether we like it or not, so let's accept the change, but reject the fear and the hesitancy and the unwillingness to prepare. We must get ahead of this coming tsunami. We have to act and not react. We don't want to fall behind the curve."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So it leads to this question. I want you to ponder this for a second. Can education and business come together, see change as an opportunity, and help Ohio succeed in the coming brave new world? Are we preparing our kids for what's coming? Business, education, government, all of us, we all need to start thinking about what new jobs are going to exist, and which ones will change. And, yes, which ones might go away. And plan together for how we will help Ohioans of all ages continue to succeed in their careers."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"To that end, I'm announcing tonight that we're creating a task force. When I hear governmental leaders say they're going to create a task force, we say wake me up when they get done with their report. But ours have been working and we're bringing a variety of industries together that will work with leading educators to look into the future, try and think about what's coming, what we might lose, what we might gain, and how do we get ourselves ready for this? Frankly, I think we'll be ahead of most of the country. And they will outline what Ohio needs to do to prepare our people for the coming changes so that we can make the future an opportunity rather than an obstacle. The need to leverage this coming future is why we're already moving. We're embracing autonomous vehicles, smart roads, drone technology, to be able to fly a drone out of the line of sight. Data analytics to chart a more effective course, sensor technology, and improve cybersecurity."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We're in a great position to capitalize on these advances. Think of the research centers. How about the Plum Brook Station - NASA's Plum Brook Station right here in Erie County, and the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which is a gem and, of course, our universities. We can get them to coordinate the research."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,Here's something most of you don't know. We have the Transportation Research Center in central Ohio. It's the most advanced independent automotive testing facility on the continent. And our capital city beat out all the others to be the hub for intelligent transportation through the Smart City initiative helping us move Ohio into the pole position for the future of smart mobility.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We also rank high among all the states for the quality and maintenance of our highway infrastructure. You saw Mr. Szollosi talking about this. Many states have fallen behind in highway repairs and improvements. We have invested $14 billion on more than 7,000 projects since 2011. That doesn't mean anything until you accept this."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"It's an increase of more than $3 billion and nearly a third of what we might normally put into infrastructure. And this has made it possible for us to free up resources, take us to the next level with new investments in these smart highways. You put the fiber in the highways and autonomous vehicles get guided by the fiber we're putting across the state, and then you have sensors so that the cars can talk to one another. We're getting ahead. The Transportation Research Center is a little village, 4,500 acres where they can come and experiment and test with a test track. We've put money into that. So has Ohio State University. So has Honda. This is exciting. It's the future. You ought to go there. We'll get you a ticket to get entrance, if you want to go down there and take your kids. It's cool to see."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Why did it happen? Well, you know, Matt Szollosi kind of talked about it. What I wanted to do, I wanted to create some bonds against tolls from the turnpike. When I mentioned the turnpike, everybody freaked out. This should have been done like 30 years ago. So what we did is we issued debt, and retired the Ohio Turnpike frequently are basically held harmless in terms of higher tolls. So all these people that use our stuff, come into our state and leave, they pay for this. And it's given us $3 billion more in infrastructure. We've moved projects that would be done 20 to 25 years from now into the ten-year window, some into the five-year window. It's been amazing and we're about to go issue more debt. Look at our infrastructure, look at our roads. Go drive in another state. And, give us a call. People now just want to drive around in Ohio. That's what it's getting to."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So this thing really worked for us. It took my partners in legislature. It took courage on the people that lived in this area because everybody was uptight about this but it worked. Transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, all these things that make Ohio what it is today, it will be changed in fundamental ways. But perhaps the most profound effects of technology will be seen in education, in the ways that Ohioans of all ages prepare for rapidly changing workforce needs. That means education for a lifetime - for a lifetime - constantly being educated and retraining. We have to get ourselves and our kids ready to take on the jobs of the future. And that requires change in our education systems, and we cannot let education get in the way of learning."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,We cannot let education get in the way of learning.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Are we preparing our kids for what I've been talking about? Do you think we're ready? I don't think so. I did recognize a number of Ohio schools for their innovative work. One of them was Cristo Rey. This is unbelievable. They partnered with local businesses and provided work experience for all their students. They basically create these interns. They get businesses to put these kids in. It starts in the very early years. The kids get paid. They are a constructive group of kids. We have some of them working in the government. They're working in industry. And they're not wealthy kids. They learn what it's like to be in a professional environment. They get excited about it, and they begin to prepare themselves for any environment because they begin to develop resilience. It's exciting."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"In Marietta, you know that they begin exploring careers with students starting in kindergarten. This one lady down there, she's a saint. She went and put this whole program together, disrupted everything. You know what she does? When kids are very little, she starts getting them to imagine what they want to be based on what turns them on. And they're out there and they're working and the businesses are involved and the community is involved. We need more of it. There are other simple initiatives."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, look, folks, I come up with a couple things. This is what gets everybody worked up. First of all, I want to make sure that our teachers, when they go for their relicense, that they spend a few days working in a business, learning about the workforce needs of the community. I don't want them to go in the military. I just want them to spend a few days at the bank, at the insurance company, at the doctor's office learning about the workforce. Everybody's all up in arms about this. Come on, folks. Look at what's coming. All I want is our teachers to be more in touch with the workforce needs of their students. We love our teachers. We don't want to overburden them, but when they go to get relicensed, let's get them out there a little bit. And I think it would really make a big, big difference for people. And I want to put -- here's another one. Now, maybe we can't find three business people. I don't know. I want to put non-voting business people on the school board. Why? Because I want the non-voting business people to start telling the school board about what the curriculum ought to look like, about how we can have flexibility, about how we can have more kids out into the workforce. We need to get them out with the people who do the hiring."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So these are just two simple, tiny little things that I think we need to get done. And I've talked to members of the legislature, and they've got some ideas. They said, look, you got better ideas? We'll do it. But we have to make sure that we create a flexible school system. And I'm with all of you. There's too much testing of these kids all the time. We keep working on it. Okay?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"That doesn't mean no testing. We've got to find out what they're learning. But also getting them out there with Steve Wilson with his bank, when he was running that bank out there before he got into politics, that would have been a great experience. I hope think kids need to see this. Universities, they're going to be a thing of the past if they're not careful. Rising costs are not sustainable. People are not going to pay this. Costs of operation, the way those costs are reflected in what students and parents have to pay. I want to give a shout out to Dr. Drake at Ohio State. He bundled up all of his industry energy operations and he leased them out for a 50 years. He's getting a half a billion dollars up front that he's going to use it for scholarships. Why? He's thinking differently. Our universities and colleges need to embrace technology and new ways of learning that can help bring these costs under control. These community colleges, they rock. I'm telling you. They get it. Okay?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"They've teamed up with Western Governors University. It's an online college that allows students to play a single, flat, low rate and move along at their pace while getting credit for what they demonstrate that they already know. There are four specialties. You can go there and get an online degree for a fraction. Georgia Tech - I think AT&T worked with Georgia Tech. We're bringing AT&T into the state to help work with us. You can get a master's degree in computer science, entirely online, not a minute in the classroom, for you know how much? $6,000. Now, I asked our universities to do this. I didn't get very far with them, but I got the community colleges working on it. The other day at Amazon, I was with the president of Columbus State and I said, I don't want any delay. What Amazon wants here for training people, I don't want any bureaucracy, red tape, obstacles, and they're going to go into southern Ohio and get kids down there trained to do jobs with Amazon for a lot of money."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Look, we can give kids a good education for a lot less. And things they can do. This Georgia Tech thing, these people do this in their own home. I understand. We go to college, we want to have that real college experience. And that will be developed. We know socialization is really important for kids. But the costs are out of control. They're going to be disintermediated, these universities. A lot of education is going to go a different way. We've got to get ahead of this. Much needs to be done but it's not beyond our reach. I'm confident we can make these changes. Just take the risks."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We have this executive workforce board made up of some of the legislators on this board, business people, labor, they all come together. They're the ones who came up with the idea of putting business leaders on the school board. They're thinking, they are helping, they're participating, and they're working. The improvements we've already achieved in economic development, of course, remind us that these big changes are possible and they can pay off."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Not long ago, people looked at what we wanted to do with economic development and wondered if the reforms we proposed would work. Okay? So we created this economic development operation. It was moving at the pace of a snail. So we decided we needed to reform it. We created JobsOhio. We were one of the first states to create an economic development agency, but over time - well, the old development agency stagnated, so we created this because we want JobsOhio to move at the speed of business."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We have experienced, knowledgeable business experts working to create new jobs for Ohioans in Ohio and get Ohio where it needs to be, at the top of the list, when business leaders around the globe think of where they want to be."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I spend a lot of my time talking with CEOs from some of the world's largest companies, and they want to know - how did you do this? How does it work? I just had a governor in another state call me up and ask me, how did you do JobsOhio? I moved to change the subject because I want us to keep winning. I don't want them to figure this out for a while."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, as JobsOhio picks up momentum deepens its roots, I want you and members of the legislature to know that they need deeper relationships with you and the people in your districts. I want you to be able to go over there anytime you want to. They are there to work, to create the jobs, and to help you to have more success in your district. And I have suggested to them - and you know, when I suggest something, what I mean. I suggested to them that they get with this and work more with all of you. They are a great organization that is extremely powerful, filled with people that have the experiences. We've got 460,000 jobs since we've come in."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So anyway, ensuring that we have the basics in place: fiscal strength, lower taxes, proper regs. It opens the door for us to sell our state across the nation and the world. Do you know what it was like to meet with the head of Siemen's? Do you know what it was like to meet with this tier-two auto company that I met in London? I said, ""If you don't come to Ohio you're making the mistake of your life."" We are the place to be. We've got the people. We've got the smarts. We've got the work ethic. We've got everything, and we're managing everything. And I can say it because it's all true."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"See, Ohio and the Midwest have a perfect opportunity to lead with the innovations of the future. Here's what the fact is. The West Coast, you sit in traffic for half of your life. It costs you a fortune to live there. Your bathroom is in your living room. And then if you live on the East Coast, go over there to New York and drive around sometime. See how it is. Send your kids there. Look at what they're paying for their apartments. You see, they're beginning to realize it's too expensive."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I had a guy call me the other day from Los Angeles. He said I hired some engineers out here. He said, I've got to hire them in Ohio. This is driving me crazy. We have some natural things that really work for us. If we think about all of this, all the things I'm talking about, the challenges, the excitement and the hope - because that's what this all is - it's so cool and it allows us to ratchet it up to the next level. We're not high enough. Up, up, up."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,One of the most critical needs for growing a workforce is healthy workers. That is why our administration and legislature have worked to make sure that those who live in the shadows or those who find themselves in tough times are not left behind.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The expansion of Medicaid has brought health care to 700,000 people, one quarter of whom have chronic illness and one-third are struggling with mental illness or drug addiction. Expanding Medicaid has freed up expanded resources in our communities to help more period, people."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We've strengthened local hospitals. We're a healthier state. I'll just tell you something quickly. I was driving home the other night from the Highway Patrol Academy at Hudson and High. You legislators know where that is. There was a guy sitting on the corner. I thought he was combing his air with his hand. As I looked more carefully, he had a cigarette lighter in his hand and he was cutting his hair with this lighter."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The guy that was driving the car - my friend that was driving the car, I looked at him and I said, that's your brother. He looked at me and said, he's my brother, too. That guy is all of our brothers. We can't ignore them. That's why I've spent so much time fighting over this health care, because I don't want to leave them behind. I don't want the drug addicted to be out somewhere. I don't want the mentally ill to be discarded, and I don't want those chronically ill to die because we couldn't get them care. And we're going to keep fighting on it."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, I go, I sit with these governors and these senators and congressmen. We don't need any of their money. We're not looking at this as a way to bail us out. Our Medicaid program, we need that money to keep helping people, but we don't need it to bail us out. Our Medicaid program is growing at a 3 percent. It's growing at a flat rate. It was 9 percent when we came in. I want to thank you for the reform of nursing homes and letting moms and dads be able to stay at home. We reduced the growth, and we're keeping it flat, but there's always more to do."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"This guy, Greg Moody, our director of Health Transformation, he's unbelievable. Now he's developing a system both with the Medicaid and with private insurers where they're going to start paying for performance. If a primary care doctor keeps you healthy, he or she is going to get a financial reward. We want transparency. We want to pay for results. We want to pay for excellence. All of that will lead to lower health care costs. They're going to follow this all over America because it's smart, it's right, it's compassionate, and it works. And thank you, Greg Moody, for what you've been doing in this whole area."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Quickly, welfare reform. Cynthia Dungey runs our welfare reform. Thanks to the legislature, we've been able to take 16 to 24 year olds. You get welfare, you stand in line, you get your food stamps, they check a box. You go over here, they check a box. We don't like that. Our 16 to 24 year olds, when they go in we will help them. But once we help them, we want to know what the problem is. We want to know how we solve your problem. We want to get you trained. We want you to get a job. Welfare without a path to work doesn't work. We want these people to have opportunity, and we want them to go to work."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"When I'm gone, you've got to expand this thing. We can't have people just going in and people checking boxes. We have to bring back caseworkers, and we've got to get at the root cause of why people are stuck."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Okay. Drug addiction. Seven years ago, I went down to southern Ohio. I wasn't even governor. And I met these ladies, and they walked in with these pictures. Well, who's on the picture? Beautiful young people - sons, daughters, football captain, cheerleader, whatever. I said, what's up, moms? They're all dead. We've got pill mills down here and they're passing these pills out. Ask Mike DeWine. He worked with me on this. They're passing out pills down here like they're going through the McDonald's for french fries. I said we will shut this down. How it operated all these years, I don't really understand. We shut the pill mills down. We put the crooked doctors in jail whenever we could. DeWine asked me to hold off and we went after them."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We moved the Highway Patrol into more aggressive interdiction to remove illegal drugs. Here's the understanding about Ohio. Why is Ohio at the epicenter of all this? It's location. The same location, 600 miles within 60 percent of the country. Okay? That helps us get employment, but, you know, it's only a day from Mexico and the drug cartels. Believe me. Talk to the patrol. It's only a few hours from Chicago. We're an artery and the patrol is busting and trying to make it so expensive that these cartels and these drug dealers aren't going to come here anymore. They had their largest seizure of heroin, meth and prescription pills last year and it's going up and up. When you see them sitting in the center of the highway, they're not sitting there to give you a ticket. You're going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit, you're in trouble. But that's not why they're there, to catch you going five miles an hour. You know what they're doing out there? They're looking because we've learned what the techniques are of the drug dealers, and they catch them. Men and women in the Highway Patrol do an incredible job. And they've got to keep it up."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So, we were one of the first states to create prescribing guidelines for doctors. Don't be giving all this stuff. We linked our medical providers into our pharmacy system to slow doctor shopping, and the first time we're registering pharmacy technicians. In the beginning we needed guidelines. You can go and try to write a law. You know what happens if you go too fast, you create an access issue. For those that are chronically ill, we're not out to take your medication away. You've got to understand that. But you're more closely watched by your physician. We started to study, what are we getting? How's it working? We expanded access to the overdose reversal drug for first responders and the families, and we created StartTalking!"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Do you know what this is all about? Talk to your kids. Talk to somebody who's not your kid. Just talk about it. Fifty percent less likelihood if somebody would do drugs, opiates, that's how they start. I tell you what I worry about, the people I love. These young kids, they go to school, and then all of a sudden there's a party and somebody says, hey, let's go in the back, they've got a bowl of pills. That's the moment of truth. We've got to love our kids and talk to them about this. The answer is no, I don't want to be cool by taking drugs. That's what we're trying to do with StartTalking!"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"We spent nearly $1 billion on this issue of drugs. Our work is paying -- look, it's paying off. A 20 percent reduction in opiate prescriptions. Doctor shopping has fallen by 80 percent. Doctor shopping - you go to this doctor, you go to that doctor, no more. You go to the pharmacy, and you ask the pharmacist what kind of things they're seeing now, and they will tell you they're seeing progress, but we're paying for the sins of the past. You see, but we haven't done enough. That's why I announced last week that Ohio is setting strict new mandatory limits. No more guidelines because we're comfortable with where we are now, but legal limits on how many opiates can be prescribed for acute medical customers. Seven days of opiates for adults and no more than five days for children. Seven for adults, five for children, no more. And many of these incidents, you will not be able to prescribe these drugs."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Let me tell you, one of the easiest things to do - I'll give you a little bit of learning here. One of the easiest things to do is just go write a law. If we would have started with this, it would have created an access problem for so many Ohioans. Doctors would say, I'm not doing it. But we worked with them and the nurses and the dentists to get us to a point where we now understand the practice patterns of doctors. If you are not in the seven or the five day, you're practicing out of line. And you know what happens if you prescribe? If you're really doing it? We'll take your license. We're not fooling around on this. All the boards have gone along with this. And John Eklund is the person that wrote giving the boards the authority. We don't have to pass it through the legislature. We don't have to take our time. It is done. Done now. And it's going to pay off for everybody in this state."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And remember - oh, by the way, these limits are more stringent than the recommendations issued by the CDC. And I've got to praise our physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Prescription opiates are often the gateway to heroin. As three-quarters of the overdose victims had previously been prescribed a controlled substance. By keeping these pills away, we can help the next generation. And, of course, addiction. It will eat anybody up, right? And we all know of this."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Our partnerships in fighting this have to be absolute, across parties, which it is. Thank God we work together. Layers of government, branches of government, the private and public sector, whichever way you want to slice it. And by the way, in your community, you better find out everything what's available. Because when we go into communities, people don't know all the things that are available. So meet, coordinate, work together -- commissioners, trustees, work together, and we'll work with you."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"The partnership that we talk about starts at home. Right at home. Right, Peterson? With your kids. Right where you are at the dinner table. It rises to our schools and communities. You know, it goes to our state government, our federal government. Everyone has a role to play. I want to thank Cliff and Larry and the members of the legislature because they've been on this. We've been total partners in this, and we're going to stay that way."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, here's a new thought. Even as we work together on this mission, do all this, drive our strategies at prevention and treatment and interdiction, we've got to have a new idea. I'm asking the Third Frontier Commission to provide up to $20 million to help bring new scientific breakthroughs to the battle against drug abuse and addiction. They're targeting existing, proven ideas and bring an extra push to be brought to the fight. Ideas like using a simple device that connects to someone's ear that can relieve pain and it blocks the effects of opiate withdrawal. You see, if you talk to the experts now, there are things that can work with the brain. If we can research and push -- that's why we're going to spend $20 million. And Dr. Rezai, one of the great pioneers of great development as most of you know up at Ohio State, he thinks it's great. The Cleveland Clinic -- maybe this is going to help us to really overcome this. I think the $20 million is going to be worth it. I'm excited. And I hope you're excited that we're thinking a little bit differently about all of this."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"You know, the crisis of drugs continues to change, so our efforts to fight it will continue to change. Through thick and thin, we've got to stay unified, supporting one another. State government will be doing its part as well by providing our communities and educators and medical professionals and other partners with new tools to help them fight this epidemic. The ultimate partnership starts with each one of us. Me, you, all of us, with our children, neighbors, and everyone around us. We love our children. We care about our neighbors. So when you go to dinner, you see a kid, just tell him not to do drugs and destroy their life. Because they have a purpose for which the good Lord created them."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, as an American and Ohioan, I'm very concerned with how divided our country has become. One reason is that people increasingly only consume news and information that reinforces their own views. I'm sure that's no one in here."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"But I want to tell you, if you're conservative, you watch conservative television, read conservative editorials, and you listen to conservative talk radio. If you're a liberal, you listen to liberal television, read liberal editorials, and you go to the Huffington Post."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"That's what we do. And then we're all experts. We gave up bowling, we took this stuff up. Okay."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"But let me ask you a question. How can we ever learn new ideas or understand how to come together with Americans from different backgrounds unless we talk to one another and hear how others think? We've gotten to the point where so much of the time we think we know everything and whoever else doesn't think the way we think -- they're just dead wrong. That's not America. We've seen an extreme division in our political system. I will tell you that I think work has been done in our state to minimize that. I believe it. These are fine people. The leadership -- fine people. Of course, the Democrats get upset. When I hear from them, I go to Republicans and say, treat them right. We're trying as best we can to pull together. But, you know, across this country, there's rising polarization and inability for the political parties to work together. This is not acceptable, nor is it sustainable for the good of our country and the good of our children."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Somebody said, what do you do about it? Well, we're not going to throw away newspapers or turn off the television. I know we're not going to do that. I tell you what I think we can think about. I believe one of the ways in which we can begin to address it -- the polarization -- is for people to find commonality in challenges that come before us. Fighting the scourge of drug addiction and death, that's not political. It's not limited to one party or one ideology or one philosophy. When somebody dies from a drug overdose, we all mourn. It's not limited to what position you take. We should fight together. Hunger in our communities, that's not liberal or conservative or Republican or Democrat. You go to Kroger, they say, would you like to round up? Round up to the dollar. You know why? Because the money goes to the food banks. That's at least what we do at our Kroger. And maybe even sometimes we take staff. We take time and we staff a food bank. Hunger knows no affiliation. I give a big shoutout to people that are out there raising money to buy coats for kids in the winter. That's not a Republican -- kids are cold. Kids are hungry. Families are out. We have to help them where we live."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,We read in the paper the death of a baby and the problem of infant mortality. That's all of us. That's shared humanity. We need to work to destroy this evil of infant mortality and help these moms to have a baby and birth a baby and make sure that those babies are going to thrive. We need to wipe out infant mortality.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"When veterans come home, veterans, people that serve overseas and any of the veterans, they need a job. How can we have sky high veteran unemployment? What are we doing in our communities? We help our veterans. Everybody agrees with that."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And how about when somebody's getting old? You know, I was out -- you know, maybe you didn't all know this, but I ran for president --"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And I was at this one town hall. For some reason I was in New Hampshire. I said, did anybody here lose a spouse? Guy raised his hand. I said, how long were you married? 60 years. When was the last time somebody took you out to dinner? It's been awhile. I will said, who's going to take you out to dinner tonight? Hands shot up. Our seniors, they need love, attention, maybe sometimes it isn't convenient for us, but we need to do it."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"You see, I think that if we can begin to address these problems, if we begin to deal with them where we live, solving these problems will bring us together, and it's up to us. If we begin to work together, we'll be surprised at how much progress we can make. We'll begin to solve some of this. We'll begin to start a dialogue that can pull our country back together, because it isn't going to come from top down. It's got to come from us up. That's the only way this is going to work. And working on these issues together in our community brings us together. We need it."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"And I'm not asking us to travel around the globe to achieve world peace or work great miracles, but simply one person at a time, right where you live, start to rebuild the foundation of our nation, and that foundation is our people and our communities and our neighborhoods. That's where America's greatness lies, with all of us, right here in Sandusky."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I tried to call Bernice King today. Today is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King. I know Bernice King. She invited me to Atlanta on Martin Luther King Day. I took one of my daughters, and it was emotional. I was on this panel -- I was being interviewed, and there were a couple, two, three hundred people, almost all minorities in there. Somebody raised their hand and said, well, what about Trump? I said, what about Trump? Let's talk about Dr. King. Dr. King didn't go to the big shots. The politicians ran the other way. Racial divide was too hot for them. Fixing the problem of race was too difficult for them politically. So what did King do? He worked the neighborhoods. He worked the communities. And I said to this person that asked that question, how's your neighbor? You know, folks, we can't give up on this. I know sometimes the problems seem too big, but you know what? You save one life, you change the world. We can't wait around for some politician to show up, any of us, to fix all this."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Issues like this will never be solved in the Statehouse alone, no matter how good our intentions are. The solutions have to start -- just what I said, I'm preaching now -- house, church, school, our town square. And when we begin to work together on local concerns we'll begin to understand one another, respect one another, like one another and joke with one another again. And we'll rediscover the shared humanity, and it opens our eyes and ears to the needs of others. We begin to heal communities. We see that pay off with the group we put together to strengthen community and police relations. A cross-section of people? That's an understatement. Law enforcement, community activists, community organizers, politicians, everybody on this panel. The chairmen -- the two co-chairmen of it, Nina Turner. Watch her on MSNBC. She'll be on tomorrow. And John Born, the head of the Highway Patrol. They came together. We are the leader in fixing the problem of police and community in this country. You know why? They sat. They listened to one another. They got it fixed."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,And wait until you read more about it. It's incredible. Sometimes I'm just amazed we got it done.
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Okay, folks. For all of this now. So now we've got to celebrate a few people who do a good job. We got this guy, Dan Rogers. He's one such person and an outstanding representative of thousands more like him across Ohio. Dan's dedicated to serving the neediest and most vulnerable among us. I can imagine Dan getting up every day and he's fighting every day. I'll tell you who's watching, the lord. He's got a book of life and he's writing Dan's name in there. He leads this Cherry Street Mission Ministries. It's in Toledo. It started in 1947. A warm meal, a place to sleep, a message of hope. Toledo - Lucas County, if they've run out of hope and have nowhere else to go, he brings them in. Dan's work is a belief that his mission is to not just provide a safety net for broken lives, but also be a springboard for helping the hungry and homeless to reconstruct their lives with the job skills and self-confidence that leads to gainful careers. He's doing it with the Life Revitalization Center. And he has reconstructed lives with training for call centers, auto body, building trades. He's now moving into tool and die, welding, and the culinary arts. He gets people jobs, and more than 90 percent of them are still working who he places and he's got them on the right track. He deserves the Courage Award for what he's doing to change lives in Toledo and Lucas County. Where is he?"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Okay. So everybody now is learning about human trafficking. Okay? So my wife told me about this guy. I mean, I kind of knew him, but not that well. He's a judge. And we have our chief justice here. How about standing up, Chief Justice? Maureen O'Connor. Give her a round of Applause"
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I tell you something, I love the judge. Nobody can beat her. She runs -- I don't even know why people put their name on the ballot. She's remarkable, but here's what's great about her. No politics. She does -- she plays no politics. She goes out. She's out there on this -- she's out there on promoting this anti-drug business. She's a leader really in the Midwest. You're something, Judge. No more pay raises right now, though. Okay? No, I'm just kidding."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"So we have Judge Paul Herbert. Let me tell you about what happened. All these ladies are coming into his court. He's checking them out and putting them all in jail. They find out they've been human trafficked. They're prostitutes because they have a pimp who is out there putting them out on the street. Drugging them, beating them, all horrible things we can imagine. We heard Senator Kunze talk about this. So the judge is the founder and driving force in Franklin County's CATCH court. Changing Actions to Change Habits. He began to realize that these people were not criminals. They were really victim's -- they were not defendants. They were victims. And they should not be subjected to criminal punishment and condemnation from which they may never recover. His CATCH court innovations diverts these victims into a two-year program that may include residential detox therapy, treatment for depression and other mental illness, they get an opportunity to get an education, they get a driver's license, and they can get help to find employment. I know they've got some food delivery operations that are just unbelievable. And best of all, when they graduate, they have the opportunity to have their convictions dismissed and their records sealed. He has helped 200 women have the opportunity to get assistance."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, when you're a judge, sometimes you're going to work the politics. Is he soft on crime? He didn't care. These women needed to be helped, and he -- come hell or high water -- he was helping them. And he has done it. And for that, I'm giving him a Courage Award. Judge Paul Herbert."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Now, okay. Got one more. One more. Okay? Damone Hudson. 24-year-old veteran bus driver. Kind of reminds me of my daddy that carried the mail. But he worked for the Greater Dayton RTA. So he's driving on his regular route. He's crossing a bridge. Over the Great Miami River. Have you ever been on those bridges? He saw a woman standing outside the bridge railing. She was going to jump. He stopped his bus, tied everything up. He didn't care. And he asked the woman to step away from the edge. He talked to her. And then he asked her, would you like a hug? Minutes later, the police arrived to help the woman to safety. He got back in the bus, went on his route."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Here's the coolest thing. A security camera on the bus caught the exchange. The footage became an internet sensation. The whole world -- the whole world was aware of Damone Hudson's quiet act of compassion. It's an example of the difference just one person can make in the life of another. He saved a life. Who knows, he may have saved the world. But think about this guy. Think about us. He just took the time. He paid attention to somebody else and kept somebody from jumping off a bridge and taking their life. Imagine the family, maybe the kids, maybe the grandkids, the spouse, loved ones. Damone saved this person. You see, you don't have to cause a miracle or bring about world peace."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Damone is a guy that is a good example for all of us to make a difference. Damone, come on out. I can't wait to meet you."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"I believe we work best when we believe in ourselves. It works best when we live a life a little bit bigger than ourselves. Etched in that wall of the Holocaust memorial, save one life, it's as if you've saved the world. I mean no problem is too big if we believe in ourselves. Love God and love your neighbor. Those are the two great commandments. The first one, love God. That means somebody greater and better than you. Love God. Love your neighbor. That's what brings out the best of us as human beings. You know, I went over there to that rollercoaster park. I mean, it's just unbelievable. And it's the thrill of Sandusky's famous rollercoasters. It's going faster and higher -- I don't know how you could go any faster or higher, but the machines only work when all the parts work together. Ohio's the same way. We can reach great heights, historic heights, but only if all of our state's pieces are working the right way."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"State government is just one of those pieces, and its role isn't to control or dictate but to serve. The state of our state remains strong. The state of our state remains stable, but holding on to the progress we've made takes continued vigilance. Challenges await and only by holding the line on conservative budgeting, fostering job creation and re-committing ourselves to helping each other along our journey will we succeed in the coming years. Ohioans, yeah, us, we make Ohio great. Government's job is to help support the environment in which they can do that and get out of their way. Right, Mr. Batchelder? Get the government out of the way and help them be successful. Help them and let them fly."
Ohio,Mike DeWine,Republican,"Let's keep going just like those rollercoasters, higher, faster, together. God bless America, and God bless Ohio. Thank you."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Temp, Lt. Governor Matt Pinnell, members of my cabinet, Madam Chief Justice, members of the 57th Legislature, my best friend — the First Lady Sarah Stitt, my children, my parents, and my fellow Oklahomans …"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"It is a great honor to stand before you to today, and I thank my heavenly Father for allowing me to be in this position of service to Oklahoma."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Let me get right to the point. The state of our state is growing in strength, stability, and new opportunity for generations to come."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We are moving in the direction we all want to go: Top Ten in the Nation.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"And we are getting there because of the hard work of Oklahoma’s entrepreneurs, because of the dedication of teachers in the classroom, because of the generous givers and compassion coming from Oklahoma’s non-profits, because of the community involvement of churches, and because of those in this room, and across our state agencies, who are making the tough, selfless decisions for the future of our great state."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"I want to take a moment to highlight a few of those individuals, who are my special guests in the Chamber today:"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"First Lieutenant E.J. Johnson, Technical Sergeant Rebecca Imwalle, and Staff Sergeant Joy Mahan. These proud Guardsmen represent the hundreds of Oklahoma’s finest called to duty during record flooding in the State this past May."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Under the leadership of Major General Michael Thompson, they walked levies, filled sandbags, performed rescues, and conducted countless other tasks day after day."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Engineers in the Oklahoma National Guard also partnered with ODOT to build a temporary road that provided evacuees in Braggs a way out of their flooded community.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In addition to their duties within the State, the Oklahoma National Guard is also fulfilling their federal mission. More than 400 Oklahoma Guardsmen are currently fighting overseas on behalf of our state and nation at this very moment. I ask that every Oklahoman keep these brave men and women in your thoughts and prayers."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Also in the Chamber with us today is Dr. Tomas Diaz de la Rubia, the University of Oklahoma’s new head of research. I am committed to partnering with our state institutions in recruiting the best talent in the nation to Oklahoma. We will compete, and we will win."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"This past year, the University of Oklahoma not only won its 13th Big 12 Football Championship, it also won the talent of one of the best researchers in the nation."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Dr. Tomas is an internationally renowned researcher who is bringing his impressive background at Purdue University, and with companies, such as Deloitte, to play a key role in identifying innovative opportunities that will elevate OU’s research reputation to Top Ten in the country. Thank you for choosing the best state in the nation to move to and make an impact."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Today, we also recognize an Oklahoma son from Tuttle — CEO of Paycom, Chad Richison. Chad founded his company, Paycom, right here in Oklahoma City in 1998, and through his vision and leadership, Paycom now serves as one of the largest employers in our great state."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Just this past month, Chad hit an incredible milestone when Paycom was added to the S&P 500 list."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Thank you, Chad, for reminding us that the American dream is still alive, and Oklahoma is the best place in the nation to accomplish it."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"To all my guests, thank you for being here today."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We all know that Oklahoma’s economy, and quite frankly our state budget, is built on the backs of the hardworking men and women in the oil and natural gas industry."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When I delivered this address last year, 60 percent more drilling rigs were operating in Oklahoma than exists today."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Our first budget together was blessed by a thriving industry. Now, we must look at the realities of a changing and evolving market that is becoming more efficient and less influenced by international volatility."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As a result, our State’s general revenue fund is estimated to be down almost one percent versus fiscal year 2020, and our total spending authority is very close to the same amount."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"But we have nothing to fear. We will remain vigilant in recognizing our needs, planning for our future, and shedding waste where operations are outdated or redundant."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In fact, the greatest challenge before us today is not Oklahoma’s economy. There are two reasons why:"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,First: The fiscal discipline displayed by many of you in this room last year has allowed the State to garner its largest savings account in Oklahoma’s history at $1 billion.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As a result, Moody’s Investor Service changed Oklahoma’s outlook from “stable” to “positive” in October. Their decision reflects an expectation that Oklahoma will maintain “strong fiscal management” and “a commitment to increasing reserves.”"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Let’s follow through on that commitment.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Senator Joe Newhouse has filed legislation that would give Oklahomans a voice this year on increasing the Constitutional cap on our State’s Rainy Day fund to 30%. Let’s get it to a vote of the people!
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"And while we wait on this vote, I am also asking for elected leaders to join me, again, in setting aside $100 million in additional funds as part of the Fiscal Year 2021 budget."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Thanks to our strong pension plans, low bond debt and progress in savings, Oklahoma is ranked as the fifth most solvent state in America. Let’s take this to #1."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"By saving in the good times, we are demonstrating our commitment to protect the taxpayer, the job creator, and the citizen who depends on core services."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Second: Oklahoma’s economy is more diverse than ever before.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When the City of El Reno faced the closure of a major facility, Oklahoma’s Department of Commerce quickly went into action."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We deployed two career fairs, and more than 350 Oklahomans were offered employment with companies in aerospace, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and more."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,This was possible because Oklahoma’s economy remains on good footing.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Our unemployment rate remains below the national average. Oklahoma’s household income has risen by nearly 4% in 2019.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"And sixty companies moved to our state or made significant expansions in Oklahoma this past year, with more than $2.9 billion in new capital investments announced."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"One of our strongest industries this year was tourism, led by the vision of our own Lt. Governor Matt Pinnell – Imagine That!"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In 2019, Oklahoma’s tourism website achieved a #1 ranking in web traffic. We beat states like California and Colorado."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"And tourism will continue to grow. This year, we are welcoming the largest movie production in state history with Killers of the Flower Moon."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"You gave us the tools last year to bolster our recruiting efforts, and the Lt. Governor was an exceptional partner in landing this deal for Oklahoma. Once again, beating states like Texas and New Mexico."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The film production’s presence is expected to inject tens of millions into our economy.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Thousands of Oklahomans will be hired as local talent and through contracts for lodging, transportation, hardware, food and more."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Oklahomans, our economy is competitive. And in this administration, we will keep it that way!"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The greatest challenge before us today is government bureaucracy.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In my first year of public service and as the chief executive, I have found government too big and too broken."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The state of Oklahoma spends roughly $20 billion annually. The Legislature has a strong handle on the 40% managed through the appropriations process.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Then, we — working together — provide oversight of the 60% that goes directly to state agencies from apportionments, fines, fees, and federal funding."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Last year, we delivered the greatest transparency to the State’s budget by publishing Oklahoma’s checkbook online."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With the new system, we are providing user-friendly access to recent spending data."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In partnership with my office and Oklahoma Treasurer Randy McDaniel, we took Oklahoma’s 47th ranking to 7th place in online budget transparency."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,And we will continue to fine tune how citizen interact with it in order to compete for first place in transparency.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Most importantly, the Legislature delivered the strongest accountability in state history when you sent to my desk legislation to reform five of our state’s largest agencies."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,This action strengthened our budgeting oversight.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Time and time again, state agencies would ask you for more money as the solution."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,But I’m here to tell you it’s not all about funding. It’s about focus. It’s about leadership.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Your reforms have allowed me to go recruit the best talent, to break down silos between agencies, and to deliver the Legislature with budgets that are results-oriented."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When good policy meets the right leadership, anything is possible!"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Just look at what transpired in 2019 between two key agencies.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When I came into office, I was told that a change in our prison system wasn’t possible without an immediate injection of $1 billion dollars."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,I was told the Pardon and Parole Board could not take on an increase in casework without more employees and more funding.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"I was told that it would be logistically impossible to accomplish a large commutation docket to give low-level, non-violent offenders a second chance."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"What did we do? You passed better policy, and we changed leadership in both agencies."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,As a result:
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Pardon and Parole Board consolidated its investigators with Department of Corrections.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,This streamlined the case work all while increasing it by 118% over 2018. They did this without a single dollar more.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The Department of Corrections launched its first-ever re-entry fairs across 28 facilities for individuals that were part of the HB 1269 commutation docket.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"The idea originated from the First Lady, and it will become a permanent practice at the agency moving forward."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"The number of Oklahomans in our state prisons declined by 7.6% from 2018. As a result, the number of those incarcerated is the lowest level since 2009. This is reducing the strain on our prison facilities and giving us the opportunity to reimagine the future of housing inmates."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"And in conjunction, the Department of Corrections withdrew its year after year request for more than $1 billion in additional funding and submitted a FY’21 request that addresses the critical needs of tomorrow."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,It is now time to complete this successful consolidation effort.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,I am calling for the Legislature to protect the Constitutional mandate for Pardon and Parole Board appointments yet pass legislation that absorbs the remainder of the operations with Corrections.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Collaboration is already taking place, thanks to the leadership of Director Scott Crow and Director Steve Bickley. It is time we make this official in law to prevent future bureaucracy from creeping back in."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When government is working and is unified under one vision, we can change the lives of Oklahomans for the better."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Here in the Chamber with us today is Tara. Tara is a mother of four children who was serving a 10-year sentence due to a relapse with a drug addiction.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Prior to her release, Tara met Chris Linder from Center for Employment Opportunities at the transition fair."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When she was commuted under the HB 1269 docket, Tara was immediately connected to sober housing at Exodus, began working a temporary job for CEO, and within a month of release was hired for a full-time position by a local Tulsa company where she is finding stability and opportunity again."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Tara, we believe in you. The State and our community partners want to help you keep a tight hold of the hope and future you and your family deserve."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Friends, agency consolidation must not stop there."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Sec. Tim Gatz has done an exceptional job leading both the Oklahoma Department of Transportation and the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Sec. Gatz is beginning the process of combining all back office and common functions into one shared service entity for both agencies.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We will maintain separate general management for unique functions, while streamlining operations that are duplicative in nature so we can deliver the highest quality of transportation possible."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We will operate with one, unifying vision for infrastructure as we continue to move towards Top Ten status. Thank you, Sec. Gatz, for your leadership."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"When Oklahoma is in crisis, it is most often our Office of Emergency Management (OEM) that is at the center of restoring us back to normal."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"OEM has the ability to call upon whatever resource it needs to help Oklahoma’s communities prevent, respond, or recover from a major crisis."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Homeland Security is a key part of that effort, proving valuable coordination to support our first responders."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"By merging these two agencies, we will bolster response capabilities, streamline coordination, and leverage existing resources for stronger prevention programs."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As we prepare to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing in April, we must continue to set the standard for our nation in how to respond to and manage crisis when tested by tragedy."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Oklahomans deserve it and this merger will help us achieve that goal.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Thank you to OEM Director Mark Gower and Homeland Security Director Kim Carter who are committed to working with the Legislature to get this done right.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Some will cry that consolidation is disruptive. Let me be clear – it will-be for political insiders and those that find comfort in big bureaucracy.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"But it is what we need to do to improve decision-making, deliver better accountability, and target dollars directly towards helping our citizens instead of paying for administrative bloat."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Oklahoma has the 20th highest land mass among states, the 28th largest population, and yet, we have the 9th most state agencies out of all 50 states. This is unacceptable."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,There is no value to having more agencies than other states; it has not solved our Bottom Ten rankings in critical categories.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As we reduce bureaucracy, we must also provide necessary relief and enhanced opportunities for our dedicated public employees."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,President Pro Tem Greg Treat and Representative Mike Osburn have already filed legislation to begin the conversation again on civil service reform.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,It is time we get this done in 2020!
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The state’s current civil service program is broken.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,High quality employees are forced into a system that doesn’t maximize their professional growth and potential.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Agency leaders have their hands tied in who they can hire and promote due to outdated restrictions.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Today, I am calling for reform that requires all new hires in state government, moving forward, to be unclassified."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"I am requesting language that allows agency directors discretion to offer bonuses, within the confines of their budgets, for employees to receive a promotion out of their restricted classified positions."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Through this attrition model, I am casting a vision for the majority of the State’s work force to be unclassified in the next five years."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As part of civil service reform, I am calling for a 3-person panel in the Human Capital Management Department to maintain whistle blower protections and to provide due process to state employees who have serious grievances, whether these employees are classified or not."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Let’s make the state’s largest employer a place where we can hire the best; where we reward good performers; and where we are building a training ground for an exceptional workforce that can transition beyond public service if they so choose.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With a long-term focus on agency reform, we will lay a new, stronger foundation for the State of Oklahoma. Any policy that the Legislature sends to my desk to further this effort will be signed. This is how we will actually get the tax-dollar directly back to the citizen - through better services."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,One of the most significant areas where we need reform is health care.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"I just returned from Washington, D.C., where I stood with the Trump administration to announce that the State of Oklahoma will be pursuing new flexibilities through the Healthy Adult Opportunity."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With these new flexibilities, Oklahoma will begin the process in the coming weeks to rollout SoonerCare 2.0."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Under this reformed Medicaid program, we will seek to close the gap of those uninsured in Oklahoma."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We will deliver much-needed accountability in the Medicaid system to focus on rewarding health outcomes and stronger performance in care.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With HAO flexibility, we will deliver personal responsibility to new enrollees under SoonerCare 2.0."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We will seek to establish moderate premiums and work requirements.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We will encourage able-bodied adults to transition towards a path of maintaining private insurance and pursuing educational or employment opportunities that advances their full personal potential.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With HAO flexibility, we will seek to establish programs that enhance accessibility of health care in rural Oklahoma."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,And we will seek to expand targeted treatment for opioid addiction and substance abuse.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,But I can’t do this without you.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Oklahoma is currently positioned to be the first in the nation to be granted the Trump administration’s waiver to achieve unprecedented flexibility and accountability in delivering Medicaid to adults.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"No one who is currently eligible will lose coverage; actually, more than 180,000 Oklahomans would gain coverage under SoonerCare 2.0."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"State Auditor Cindy Byrd is in the middle of auditing our Medicaid rolls, a request I filed last year. Her auditors expect to be done this spring, which will allow us to address abuse in the system and ensure that the reformed SoonerCare 2.0 will truly help those who need it the most."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,But Washington needs to see support from the Oklahoma State Legislature to feel confident that this plan is on solid financial standing.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Today, I call on the House and the Senate to send to my desk legislation to give certainty that the Oklahoma Health Care Authority can use the full 4% of the SHOPP assessment to fund SoonerCare 2.0, while protecting reimbursements."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We must also reform TSET. Let’s protect the current corpus yet reallocate future funds towards improving the delivery of rural healthcare.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Help me keep Oklahoma #1 in competing for this new opportunity through the Trump administration.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Any other effort to enact a clean expansion of Medicaid, to include putting it in the State’s Constitution, will create significant restrictions."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"With straight Medicaid Expansion, Oklahoma will be left with the same ineffective and unaccountable program that has failed to bring us out of Bottom Ten rankings."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"The time is now to innovate, to focus on outcomes, and to make Oklahoma a national leader in the delivery of healthcare."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"To make this sustainable, we must also move forward on significant reforms in the operations of our state health and human services agencies."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Did you know that Oklahoma has 10 different state agencies passing money through the Medicaid program in Oklahoma?
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,And 18 state entities that license health care facilities and providers?
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,You cannot convince me that operating that many bureaucracies is an efficient way of doing business. And it has to change.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,This is why I am calling for the Legislature to begin the process of creating one central health care agency.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Let’s partner together to fully integrate, by the year 2022, the functions of the State Department of Health, the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA), the Department of Mental Health, and others, as well as all of the state’s licensing boards that deal with health."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In addition, Oklahoma can no longer afford to be so far behind other states with regards to using and protecting health data."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Within the next couple months, we will select a vendor to establish a statewide Health Information Exchange (HIE)."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"This effort has been a long-time in the making and with the right leadership in place, more progress has been made in 10 months than in the last 10 years. Thank you OHCA Director Kevin Corbett and Secretary Jerome Loughridge."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"A functional HIE will protect Oklahomans’ health records while ensuring these records are portable and accessible at all times, and I appreciate Senator Greg McCortney’s legislation that will enhance and protect the hard work underway in our agencies."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,And this is just the beginning of health reform in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Many of you in the Legislature are spearheading legislation that will help to create a better healthcare system across the board, to include legislation that will create pricing transparency for medical bills, and Representative Marcus McEntire’s legislation to put an end to surprise billing practices."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Thank you. Let’s continue to work together and push the envelope on improving health care delivery and outcomes for all 4 million Oklahomans.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In this administration, we will continue to focus on becoming Top Ten in education."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"It is why the Legislature put more funding into the funding formula this school year, bringing the total taxpayer investment in common education to the largest in state history."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We will protect it. But we must also reform it by taking a hard look at our state’s funding formula.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We should allow voters to unlock more local dollars. With reform, we must also address any mechanisms that are preventing tax dollars from getting directly to today’s classroom."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,The path to Oklahoma’s future prosperity will be achieved by promoting the profession of teaching and focusing on students’ advancements and opportunities.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"This is why the Legislature rallied last year to give our teachers a second year of much-deserved pay raises. I am glad to report that not only did districts give pay raises of at least $1,220 last year, but some went beyond, like Owasso Public Schools, where now a first-year teacher can expect a beginning compensation of $42,000."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"It is why this Legislature continues to build a competitive and solvent Teacher Retirement System, by investing more than $300 million annually above the $750 million that taxpayers support through employee and employer contributions."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Our dedication will continue so that teachers know that when they retire, their pensions will be funded."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,But more state revenue is not the answer alone.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"We must also continue to recruit the best teachers and confront our teacher shortage. I support legislation that would direct the State Board of Education to issue a teaching certificate to anyone who holds a valid out-of-state teaching certification, with no other requirements except a criminal history record check."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"This year, we must get across the finish line proven solutions to enhance learning opportunities for students."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Now is the time to raise the cap on the Oklahoma Equal Opportunity Education Scholarship to $30 million, to allow Oklahomans to be rewarded for investing their funds directly to our students and schools"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In the Chamber, as my special guests, are Ms. Alegra Williams and her sixth- and eighth-grade sons, Chaves and Sincere."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Ms. Williams’ sons were struggling in school, making all C’s and D’s until she had the opportunity to enroll them in Crossover Preparatory Academy, a private all-boys school in north Tulsa."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Crossover prep was started as a key initiative to restore their community through education for young men. Crossover Prep is a tuition-free school because they believe that a child’s access to a quality education shouldn’t be dependent on their parent’s ability to afford it.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In the boys’ first semester at Crossover, Chaves jumped three reading grade levels, and Sincere jumped two-and-a-half reading levels."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Chaves and Sincere, will you stand? And will everyone join me and their mom in applauding their hard work this year?"
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Chaves and Sincere were able to get the help they needed because of the Oklahoma Equal Opportunity Education Scholarship Act.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Increasing the tax credit cap will provide additional incentives for donors, resulting in more public-school grants and private-school scholarships."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Thank you to Senator Dave Rader and Representative Jon Echols for leading the charge.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Let’s work together to make sure all students at all schools have access to an innovative, enriching curriculum, regardless of ZIP code."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Because we believe in all students and helping them succeed, I am also launching a program this year called Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG)."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,JAG is a state-based national non-profit organization dedicated to preventing dropouts among young people who have serious barriers to graduation and employment.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In more than three decades of operation, JAG has delivered consistent, compelling results – helping more than one million young people stay in school through graduation, pursue postsecondary education and secure quality entry-level jobs leading to career advancement opportunities."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"While we are on the topic of education, let me take a brief moment to address one critical matter."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"In 2019, 1.3% of the common education funding came from the State’s exclusivity fees on Class III games on tribal casinos. These dollars, which are first deposited to the Oklahoma Education Reform Revolving Fund, equal roughly $130 million compared to public education’s total funding of $9.7 billion, as sourced by the 2019 School District Revenue Report."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"The Model Gaming Compacts have been a success, greater than anyone predicted."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Unfortunately, we have an expired Model Gaming Compact, a compact in which notable tribes have previously called “dated” and “unsuitable” for current and future business."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"After 5 offers from the State for all stakeholders to come together to modernize the Model Gaming Compact, three tribes instead sued the State on New Year’s Eve."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"While we wait for the federal court’s decision, I am calling for the Legislature to join me in protecting public education. I am asking for legislation that will allow the remaining cash balance from 2019 and funds from the Revenue Stabilization Fund to be leveraged, if needed, to compensate for any temporary pause in Class III gaming fees."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As Governor, I remain supportive of the sovereignty of the State of Oklahoma and our right — and your duty as the Legislature — to oversee all industries operating in the State."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"I also remain confident the State and Oklahoma’s tribes can hammer out a compromise that is a win-win for all four million Oklahomans, and we can accomplish this without putting public education in the crosshairs."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"As I said last year, and it bears repeating, we need more taxpayers, not more taxes."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Everything we do has a dotted line back to growing our economy.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"It is why my budget calls for the funding of the Closing Fund by another $3 million, as well as a $200 million financing plan with a majority prioritized towards rural roads and high-volume interchanges."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Oklahoma has moved from 49th to 13th in bridge conditions within 15 years, and while we work towards Top Ten in this critical category, we are going to start moving the needle on our ranking of super-two roads and pavement quality."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Oklahoma is the crossroads of America, and our roads are key to attracting future job creators whether it is to Altus, Enid, Broken Bow or in the heart of Tulsa."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Today, I am also filing an executive order to address Oklahoma’s excessive red tape."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Oklahoma’s administrative code is double the size of the state of Kansas and 20 percent more than Missouri and New Mexico.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,My executive order will call for the first-ever comprehensive review of the State’s administrative code and will instruct agencies to remove two regulations for every new one created.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"The intent is to reduce red tape by 25% in the next three years, providing relief to Oklahoma’s job creators and farmers and ranchers while also strengthening our recruitment efforts to diversify and grow Oklahoma’s economy."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,We must also continue our progress on occupational licensing reform.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,Speaker Charles McCall and Senator Adam Pugh made it a priority last year to reduce barriers to work for military families.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,And Senator Julie Daniels and Rep. Zach Taylor passed meaningful second-chance legislation to expand occupational licensing opportunity for those who have previously encountered the justice system.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"This year, let’s get universal licensing recognition across the finish line too. We can continue to make progress on economic prosperity when we remove unnecessary and antiquated barriers to entry."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Oklahoma is competing. Oklahoma is winning. Oklahoma is undergoing the Turnaround that voters demanded."
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,It may not be comfortable at times. It demands hard decisions and boldness. It requires long-term planning and commitment to one vision.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,But we are making inroads that will last for generations… that will make us stronger… more prosperous… Top Ten.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,There is no place I would rather be than Oklahoma.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,There is no better team than the ones elected in this room.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,There is no better time in our State’s history than now. Let’s do this together.
Oklahoma,Kevin Stitt,Republican,God bless you. And God bless the great State of Oklahoma.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Good afternoon everyone.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Thank you all so much for being here.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Senate President Peter Courtney, Speaker Tina Kotek, thank you."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"To our Tribal Chairs and leaders, welcome."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"To newly elected legislators, congratulations and welcome."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,It’s an incredible honor to serve Oregon for four more years.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Today is a little bittersweet or me, as this ceremony marks my final four years as governor. But, aside from how this feels for me, this is an important moment for our state."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"In many ways, Oregon is progressing on ground that many of our neighbors wish they could tread."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Our unemployment rate is the lowest on record.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We have one of the fastest job growth rates in the country.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"And in November, Oregonians defeated ballot measures that would have moved us backwards. Together, we used our vote to affirm Oregon values."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,In many ways we stand alone.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"For years we have struggled to overcome the impacts of recession on our state revenue, to build up adequate funding for our education system, and stabilize access to health care."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Our state is growing faster than at any point in our lifetimes. With growth comes a lot of really good things. More jobs. More ideas. And hopefully, more opportunities."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"At the same time, not everyone is experiencing this prosperity."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Across Oregon, communities large and small are struggling with homelessness. This crisis is playing out daily on our streets — and on our sidewalks."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"For many families, the cost of housing, health care, child care, and higher education are all outpacing wage growth."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,And all of this is against the backdrop of a federal government that has never been in more disarray.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Now is the time to put our state on a better path forward.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,The first step is to ensure that our democracy is strong. And fight every effort to undermine it.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Voting is our country’s greatest collective responsibility, and we must vigorously safeguard the sanctity of our elections.  While our elections institutions are amongst the best in the nation, we have more work to do to ensure that every single voice is heard."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"I will work for campaign finance reform, fight for paid postage on our ballots, and expand our automatic voter registration system."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I’d welcome your help.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"While other states are rolling back voting rights, Oregon is leading the way."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Vote by mail and Oregon’s motor voter have made it so that we have one of the highest voter participation rates in the country.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"But when it comes to campaign finance, we are still the wild wild west. This needs to end."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,No one should be able to buy a megaphone so loud that it drowns out all the other voices.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Next, we are facing an affordability crisis in health care and housing that needs to be addressed immediately."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Health care is a fundamental right.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Because of the work we’ve done to expand the Oregon Health Plan, today 94 percent of adults have access."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"And because of the work we did to pass Cover All Kids, every single one of our children has access."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Let’s work together to make sure every Oregonian has the health care they need.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"My budget sets forth a consensus approach as to how we stabilize funding for the Oregon Health Plan. Let’s make it happen, and let’s move quickly."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Families across Oregon need to know that they’ll be able to see a doctor when they’re sick. And that means giving them certainty as soon as we can this session.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Also fundamental is that every Oregonian should have a warm, safe, dry place to call home. And it should be affordable and accessible."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We have a housing crisis. We have to act quickly to help the chronically homeless and our children and families and our veterans.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,My budget makes a historic $400 million investment in housing.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"It’s an ambitious plan. But if we move now, we can get results quickly."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We can’t keep doing the same thing expecting a different result, which is why I’m going to ask you to try something new."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"If you approve a $20 million bonding package early this session, we can speed up construction of 200 units of permanent housing for the chronically homeless."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We also need to help Oregonians who have homes but are struggling with the high cost of rent. When problems arise, they need technical assistance to stay in their homes and not end up on the streets. We can help landlords and tenants navigate this tight housing market."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Speaker Kotek and Senator Burdick have innovative proposals that will give renters some peace of mind.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Oregon families are counting on us.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,They are counting on us so they don’t have to make a choice between paying the rent and staying home with their newborn.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,They are counting on us to make sure that their children are safe and that they can afford child care.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Let’s work to take those worries off the table by working for paid family leave and affordable, accessible daycare."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,As elected officials we have to prioritize our resources while leading during trying times.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I want to take a second to thank all of our state employees and volunteers who are working to keep federal facilities accessible to Oregonians during the government shutdown.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Government should be working for the people.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"During my entire time as Governor, I have focused on spending every taxpayer dollar wisely. We worked together on this last session. We’re not going to get credit for that work, but that’s not the point. We still have to do it."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I am focused on several important items this session. And I put them in my budget.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"First, adding internal auditors, who will ensure that every state agency is delivering the level of service that Oregonians expect while saving every penny they can along the way."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Second, eliminating backlogs and decreasing wait times in critical areas, like child-care licensing and food safety inspections."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Third, modernizing the way we deliver services and purchase goods. We can save taxpayer dollars if we streamline the way state government does business. Especially by implementing a new centralized procurement system."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"While we tackle today’s pressing fiscal challenges, we also must address the challenges of our future."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Today, we stand at a turning point, with an opportunity to put Oregon on a better path forward."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Our young people deserve to inherit an Oregon as beautiful and bountiful as the one we cherish today.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,It is extremely painful to watch the effects of climate change on our communities.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,The Rogue Valley was covered in smoke for over eight weeks last summer.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Ninety percent of our state is in drought.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,And last year was the warmest year in Oregon since 1895.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Wildfires have increased in intensity and severity in the past decade, threatening our culture, our communities, and our economy. Oregon must continue to pursue solutions that will reduce harmful emissions while creating good jobs and building a clean energy economy."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"A couple of weeks ago, I received a letter from Abner. He’s 10 years old."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,He wanted to make sure that I knew the consequences of inaction.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"On one side of the card he drew an Earth struggling from years of global warming. “Hot, hot, hot,” read the caption. The Earth was frowning."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,On the other side was an image of an Earth in perfect health. A beaming smile stretched across the planet.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,“What are you doing about climate change?” Abner wrote.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Well Abner, I hope you’re listening. Because we’re on it."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Twelve years ago, Governor Kulongoski set the limit on carbon emissions. And now, this session, we need to meet those goals."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Thank you, Governor Kulongoski for your leadership, and thank you to the legislators—both Republican and Democrat—for the work you’re doing to lead the way."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I look forward to signing our clean energy jobs bill this session.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Just as our climate is changing, our economy is rapidly changing."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We need to make sure that every single one of our students is Future Ready.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,That means each one of them graduates from high school with a plan for their future and the skills to compete in a global economy.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Higher education also needs to be more affordable and more accessible to Oregon families.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"The good news is, our current strong economy gives us the best chance in a generation to address persistent, structural challenges in our education system. The time is now. If we wait, we’ll only fall further behind when the economy eventually falters."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"At one time, every Oregonian was proud of our education system. It was a promise that if you chose to put down roots in Oregon, your children would receive a world-class education and have the opportunity to achieve their dreams. But over the past couple of decades, we have failed to deliver on that promise."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We have not significantly increased per pupil spending since the early 1990s. While other states were able to invest in schools and take advantage of economic recoveries, Oregon has had to rely on state funds to backfill local property taxes."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"How our state provides for the needs of our children is a marker of who we are as a community. After years of underinvestment, it’s going to take more than just additional funding to bring our schools back to a level we can be proud of."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We have failed our students of color and we have left rural Oregon behind. Now is the time to close that opportunity gap.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Our education system is in desperate need of repair, reform, and reinvestment. It’s like an old house that hasn’t been maintained. The longer we wait, the more it will cost to fix it."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"I will work with you, the business community, teachers, and parents to fund K-12 schools at a level that ensures our districts aren’t forced to make cuts."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,My budget also includes resources to stabilize PERS rates for schools. This is in addition to the dedicated investments we began last year.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,The unfunded liability in PERS is not going away. We must accelerate our work to stabilize PERS rates so that new dollars go directly into the classroom.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Over the past year, we have worked with your Student Success Committee to build consensus on how to repair our schools."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We agree that we need to prepare an additional 10,000 kids for kindergarten."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We agree that we need to create a School Improvement Fund that invests in our students. And provides smaller class sizes and a longer school year.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We agree that every single high school student must have the opportunity to participate in job training classes like CTE or hands-on learning.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We agree that we need to attract, train, and retain the best teachers in the country."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,And we agree that we have to keep tuition affordable and open the doors to higher education.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,My expectation is that these investments we’re making in education will improve outcomes for all of our kids.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Oregonians deserve transparency as to how their taxpayer dollars are being spent.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"As Superintendent of Schools, I will streamline my oversight of our education system and ensure greater accountability. The Chief Education Office will sunset next year and the majority of the functions will move directly into my office."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"We will hold school districts accountable by auditing the School Improvement Fund to ensure that new dollars are used to improve graduation rates, reduce class sizes, and provide a full school year."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I was the oldest of four kids. My mom taught me to squeeze every single bit of toothpaste out of the tube.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Oregonians need to know that state government is using every taxpayer dollar wisely.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Health care, housing, protecting our environment, defending our democracy, and investing in our children. These are fundamentals. But solving the problems before us, turning the corner—it’s not going to be easy."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,That’s OK. We know how to do the tough stuff. We do it the Oregon way: Working across the aisle and around the state.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. We do what we’ve done time and again: put politics aside and serve the people of Oregon."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"And to the new members who are joining us this year, I offer you again my congratulations, and a word of advice: put on your metal underpants."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Politics can be messy, and a term in the legislature is not for the faint of heart."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,But having the privilege to serve Oregon is an incredible honor.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,And one that I take very seriously.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"28 years ago, Barbara Roberts, the first woman elected governor of Oregon, was sworn in."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,On this day. In this same room.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Thank you, Governor Roberts, for your advice and counsel and for opening the doors for women like me."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I also want to say thank you to Governor Kulongoski for being my friend and mentor.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I am truly standing on the shoulders of giants.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Even if they are short giants.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I started my career as an advocate for children and families and I intend to end it as one.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,In closing I want to share a little bit about Jacob Burris. We met this summer.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Jacob is 17 years old. His mother paid for their basic needs by waiting tables. And Jacob’s health care was covered by the Oregon Health Plan because he has a chronic health condition.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,It hasn’t slowed him down.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Jacob is incredibly talented.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,He designs sweatshirts and shoes for the Doernbecher Foundation.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,And thanks to the Affordable Care Act he’s had access to the medical care that he needs.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"His life decisions, including his profession, will be dictated by his ability to get health insurance."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Because Jacob has a pre-existing condition.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"The good news is that unlike many states, Oregon protects people like Jacob."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"And at home, he has a mother who works really hard."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Fortunately, she just got a new job with health care coverage and can start saving and finally get ahead."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,I am so delighted that Jacob and his mom are here today.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Our state is at a turning point, just like Jacob’s family."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Today we have a choice. Are we willing to do the work to make the dream of a better Oregon come true?
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,We are. And Jacob’s story should serve as an inspiration to get this done.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"In talking to Jacob, his diagnosis changed everything. But living with a pre-existing condition fueled his creativity."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"He figured out how to communicate with the world in new ways, by designing shoes and sweatshirts that tell a story."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,He has figured out how to talk about living day-to-day with a medical condition that will stay with him his entire life.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"And in doing so, he has literally blazed a path for his future."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Maybe he’ll get a job with one of our homegrown apparel companies. Or maybe he’ll start one himself.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,"Regardless of what the future holds, I know for Jacob there’s no looking back."
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,The time is now. Our future is in front of us. We have to turn the corner and make it a reality. Together we can build a better Oregon.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,One that will make Jacob proud to call Oregon home.
Oregon,Kate Brown,Democrat,Thank you.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,Thank you!
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"First - always first - I want to thank Frances, and our two wonderful daughters: Sarah and Katie.  I love you, and I wouldn't be here without you. I also want to thank Sarah and Katie's husbands, our sons-in-law, Joe and Jamie."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Thank you, Govs. Ridge and Schweiker, for being here, and for your service and commitment to Pennsylvania."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"I'd also like to thank Chief Justice Saylor, Speaker Turzai, President Scarnati, Leader Cutler, Leader Dermody, Leader Corman, Leader Costa, and the members of our judiciary and general assembly for being here, as well as all of the family, friends, and invited guests who have made today so special."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"I'd like to say a special thank-you to Mike Stack for his hard work over the last four years.  And I'd like to thank Lt. Gov. John Fetterman for his commitment to public service, and for his friendship, as we tackle the next four years as partners. The tie looks good on you, John."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Most of all, I want to thank the people of Pennsylvania.  Thank you for the honor you have given me of serving as your governor.  Thank you for the inspiration you provide to me every day."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Not too long ago, Frances and I got a call from our daughter Sarah.  She had really good news.  After years and years of what she'd probably call ""hectoring"" — but we'd call ""gentle encouraging"" — she and her husband, Joe, were finally moving back to Pennsylvania."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"When you have talented kids — and we do: Sarah's an architect, Joe is a graphic designer and Katie's a geologist and Jamie is running his own business — you always run the risk that they're going to run off and do something great somewhere else."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"When I first took this oath four years ago, far too many parents across our state were worried that their kids would wind up moving away — that they would have to move away, if they were going to find the quality of life they desired."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"That anxiety cuts to the core.  That's not who we should be.  We are not like any other state.  We began as a holy experiment in tolerance and inclusion, and for more than 300 years, history has chosen us as its crucible."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,Pennsylvania is where America declared her independence.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Pennsylvania is where our founders wrote not one, but two constitutions, and sparked our nation's evolving political experiment with those truths we hold to be self-evident but still seek to fully realize."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,Pennsylvania is where Lincoln came at America's most vulnerable moment to eulogize the heroes of Gettysburg and call for a new birth of freedom that we still seek to fully implement for all Americans.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,And history is still being written right here in Pennsylvania. You see it when you visit the world-class universities and teaching hospitals where innovation is happening every day. You see on the farms and in the steel plants where our great work ethic is on display. You see it when you trace our evolution from dirt tracks to canals to rivers to railroads to highways.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,Pennsylvania continues to be a place where history is made.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"So, a big part of who we are as Pennsylvanians is the pride we have in where we're from.  And we want to pass that pride down to our kids, so they can instill it in their children the way our parents instilled it in us."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"But when I spoke to you for the first time as Pennsylvania's governor, I spoke of a commonwealth at a crossroads.  We were still proud of our storied past, but the future had never looked more uncertain."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"You could look around and see the causes of that anxiety: an economy struggling to keep pace with rapid change, workers' wages not keeping up with the skyrocketing cost of living, a budget deficit that threatened our fiscal future, a billion-dollar shortfall in education funding that was crippling our public schools."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"We were mired in a crisis of confidence, and for good reason: Parents no longer felt like they could promise their kids that Pennsylvania had opportunities to offer them — that their lives would be better than their own.  Business owners no longer felt sure that the soil from which great companies had long grown was still fertile."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"And citizens of this great commonwealth no longer trusted that our leaders could find common ground.  Frankly, after so many failures, we no longer trusted them to do much of anything."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"It wasn't a Republican or Democratic thing.  It was a simple lack of faith in Harrisburg's ability to solve problems in a way that put people first.  Here, in the birthplace of American democracy, many of us had come to the conclusion that, no matter who we voted for, our government was simply broken beyond repair."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Our continuous experiment in representative government embarked on by our founders became subject to doubt by far too many. That too many felt their promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness had become out of reach."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"And because of that, the challenges that we faced seemed insurmountable."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Four years later, those challenges haven't disappeared.  But we've proven that those problems really aren't insurmountable."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Pennsylvania has created more than 200,000 new jobs — good jobs that support families."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"We've improved more than 20,000 miles of roadways and restored more than 1,900 bridges."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,We've restored $1 billion to our schools and enacted a fair funding formula to make sure that our children's opportunities are not restricted by his or her ZIP code.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,We've turned a $2.5 billion deficit into a surplus and made the first deposit to our rainy day fund in over a decade.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"We've expanded Medicaid to cover an additional 720,000 Pennsylvanians, and increased enrollment in the CHIP program so it now serves nearly 180,000 children."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"We've gotten more than 4,200 homeless veterans off the streets and into permanent housing and we've helped tens of thousands of seniors and people with disabilities get care in their homes."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,The graduation rate is up. The uninsured rate is down. Pre-K enrollment is up. Crime is down. We've got more people working and fewer people in prison.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"And while we've had plenty of fierce arguments in Harrisburg, that hasn't stopped Democrats and Republicans from working together to legalize medical marijuana, modernize our liquor system, make our pets safer, and pass comprehensive pension reform that puts our fiscal future on sounder footing."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Our differences haven't stopped us from putting a down payment on criminal justice reform with the clean slate bill, instituting new protections against domestic violence, and passing our first gun safety law in decades."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Look: we all come to public service with convictions that we know we can't compromise.  I certainly do.  And I know my friends in the Legislature do, as well.  So sometimes we'll disagree.  And sometimes we'll have to agree to disagree."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"But that doesn't have to stop us from working together to make progress for Pennsylvania where we have common ground.  As Leader Corman said, we're not like Washington.  We can work together here in Harrisburg.  We can get things done."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"My fellow Pennsylvanians: We've gone from a commonwealth at a crossroads to a commonwealth on a comeback.  And today, even as we reflect on our pride in the Pennsylvania we inherited from our parents, we can look forward to the future with renewed hope that we'll leave an even better Pennsylvania for our children."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Now, I'd love to take credit for all of that.  Heck, while we're at it, I'd love to take credit for the Eagles winning the Super Bowl, Villanova winning the Final Four — twice, and the Penguins bringing home the Stanley Cup — twice."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"But the accomplishments of the last four years aren't my accomplishments.  These are our accomplishments.  Pennsylvanians have earned the right to feel optimistic about our future.  And as we look forward to the next four years, I want us to be ambitious in imagining the Pennsylvania we can build together."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"A Pennsylvania where we continue to invest in our schools, where we continue to rebuild our infrastructure, where we continue to lead in research and development, where we continue to prioritize opportunity and prosperity for all of our communities and all of our children.  Where we don't wait around for Amazon to move here, because we're building the next Amazon."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"A Pennsylvania where we don't just have enough to take care of our own, but enough to take care of each other.  Where people living in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh understand the importance of our agricultural sector and the needs of our rural communities.  Where people living in McKean County appreciate the power of our world class cities. Where the business community recognizes the value of an energy policy that protects our environment and creates good jobs.  Where we attack the opioid crisis that has taken so much from so many families."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"A Pennsylvania where we don't just fondly recall William Penn's commitment to tolerance, and the founders' civic spirit, and Lincoln's political courage, but seek to emulate these heroes and reflect their values in our own time.  Where we reform a criminal justice system that treats African-Americans and the poor unjustly; where we stand as one to stop discrimination against the LGBTQ community, and where we commit to a process that makes our elections fairer and, where we give every Pennsylvanian the same chance to determine our shared future."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"I know this sounds like a lot to ask of a divided Harrisburg.  And, the truth is, none of it is possible without trust."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"That's why I've made transparency and ethics reform a top priority: implementing the gift ban, refusing to take a salary, cutting waste and red tape from state government, and saving billions in taxpayer money."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"But while I will continue this fight to make Harrisburg work for you, I'm not going to stand up here and ask you to forget about the lack of trust that came before.  Some stains do take a long time to wash away."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"So I'm not asking Pennsylvanians to trust me, or any other politician in Harrisburg.  I'm asking them to trust in themselves.  Because that's where I put my faith every day I wake up with the privilege of holding this office."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Last October, on what was unquestionably the toughest day I've had in this office, Frances and I were in Beaver County when we got the news about the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"We raced the 45 minutes to the scene, but all I could do was share in the grief and agony of that horrible day.  I remember seeing Mike Turzai and Jay Costa there, and in that moment, we weren't Republicans or Democrats.  And, for that matter, they weren't legislative leaders and I wasn't the governor.  We were just like everyone else, feeling helpless and heartbroken."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"But in the days that followed, the people of Pennsylvania lifted us all up.  Law enforcement officers who had responded to the scene continued to do their jobs with the courage and grace and professionalism that makes them heroes.  High school students from Taylor Allderdice organized an interfaith vigil that night, and more than 3,000 people showed up.   The head of the local Islamic Society offered to provide guards to stand watch, so people could feel safe while they grieved the dead at memorial services in their synagogues.  Thousands came from all across Pennsylvania to lay stones and show solidarity."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"I'm so grateful that you, Rabbi Myers, could be with us today. Your leadership and strength, along with so many others, showed us the way to move forward."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,We all came together. We all did what we could. We all leaned on each other.  We all found the strength to carry on.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,That's who we are. That's the Pennsylvania I grew up in; the Pennsylvania Frances and I raised our family in; and that's the Pennsylvania we should all want.
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Way back in 1749, Ben Franklin was sitting on the dock in Philadelphia, watching thousands of people stream off ships from Europe, most from Germany.  Franklin wrote that he was worried about whether Pennsylvania could survive the arrival of so many German immigrants."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Ben Franklin was right about a lot of things, but not about this.  He should have had more faith in Pennsylvania.  And I'm not just saying that because he was talking about my ancestors.  Throughout its history, Pennsylvania has never been defined by one ethnicity, or one religion, or one ideology, or one region.  We've always been diverse.  And we've always been at the epicenter of change."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"From the American Revolution to the Civil War to the Industrial Revolution, from the days of steel and coal to the days of innovation and technology, Pennsylvania has been asked to adapt to change and respond to challenges, time and time again."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"That isn't our curse.  It's our blessing.  Our ability to come together again and again, across whatever boundaries may divide us, and renew this great political experiment for another generation — that's what made Pennsylvania the place I'm so proud to be from."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"And now, we are challenged again."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Challenged to re-imagine our workforce for a new century so that more of our children can find opportunity right here in Pennsylvania.  Challenged to protect the progress we've made in restoring our schools and our fiscal security.  Challenged to keep making our state stronger, and fairer, and more prosperous."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"I'm ready to do my part.  But, today, I'm asking you, the people of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to do your part, as well."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"In this last election, we saw increased voter turnout in all 67 counties.  But voting isn't the end of your responsibility in helping to shape our shared future.  It's just the beginning.  It's long past time we re-discover democracy together — because if we're going to build the kind of trust we need to make progress in Harrisburg ... if we're going to renew our faith in Pennsylvania's future ... it won't come from me or anyone else on this stage.  It'll come from you, the people of this great commonwealth."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"So, today, I ask you to choose hope over hopelessness, empathy over apathy.  I ask you to choose action over passivity.  I ask you to take the future of our commonwealth into your own hands and help lead us forward."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"My fellow Pennsylvanians, no longer are we stuck at a crossroads.  We have chosen a path of progress.  We have earned the right to feel not just proud of our past, but hopeful for our future."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"So, let us have faith in each other."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Let us have faith in what we can fix together, what we can achieve together - what we can build together."
Pennsylvania,Tom Wolf,Democrat,"Thank you, and God bless you! And God bless the commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Good evening, Speaker Mattiello, Senate President Ruggerio, members of the House and Senate; members of the Judiciary, my family -- and most especially -- my fellow Rhode Islanders. It's an honor to join you at the start of a new year and with so much at stake for Rhode Island and our nation. I'm humbled by the opportunity to continue serving as your Governor. My family and I are deeply grateful for your trust."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"When we began our work together four years ago, Rhode Island was stuck -- and everybody knew it. Our unemployment rate was among the nation's highest, schools were crumbling, and our roads were ranked the worst in the country. Rhode Island is a small and connected state so we all knew someone who was out of work. The struggle was everywhere you looked."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"After spending so much time talking with so many people who had been out of work, some for over a year or more, I vowed to be the Governor who would get Rhode Island back to work. Rhode Island is a place where people have always taken pride in our work, and we're proud to call Rhode Island home. So together, we shook up the old ways of doing things, and brought the change needed to get back on our feet again -- and to create jobs and build a bright future for our children."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"As a direct result of our new approach, we went from the having the highest unemployment rate in America to now having more jobs in our state than at any time in our state's history. We went from having the worst roads in America to more road construction happening right now than at any other time in our lifetimes. More Rhode Islanders are on track to graduate from CCRI than ever before. And thousands of people are getting good jobs because we worked with employers to build new job training programs that have become a national model. We've cut taxes, regulations and red tape for small businesses. And given middle class Rhode Islanders a tax cut every single year for the past four years. When we started, there was a freeze on school construction. But today, we're fixing our schools, and last year Rhode Islanders approved a once-in-a-generation investment to bring all of our school buildings into the 21st century. TF Green is thriving. We're the only state in America with an offshore wind farm. And we are number one in the nation for Pre-K."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"We have stopped the decline and ignited a comeback. And it's because of you, Rhode Island -- all of us -- working together. We should feel proud of the work we've accomplished. But we have so much more to do. Our work's not done until every Rhode Islander has a shot at a good job. Until every child has a chance to attend an excellent public school -- until no one who works full time is in poverty."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Let's make the decisions that will sustain our economic progress and build an economy that's strong, resilient and inclusive -- one where everyone has a real chance to get ahead. Let's show that it's possible to be business friendly and fair to employees. Let's prepare people for jobs of the future. Our world is changing rapidly, and the state of our state is strong -- and much stronger than it was four years ago. But our future depends on the decisions we make today."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"This week, I'll send to you a budget that expands our investments in job creation and job training; protects our most vulnerable; preserves our investments to finally end the opioid and overdose crisis; gives every Rhode Islander a big cut in their car tax; invests in our beautiful, cherished public parks, beaches and public spaces; and sets Rhode Island on a path for long-term prosperity."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"When it comes to our future, nothing is more important than our children. In the past four years, we've made record investments in K-12 education, and it's starting to pay off. We've increased the number of high-quality career and technical training programs at our high schools by nearly 60 percent. We're the only state in America to teach computer science in every public school. And 40 percent more students are taking AP and advanced classes."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,But the recent test scores are just not acceptable. We've lagged behind our neighbors for far too long. Let's resolve to do whatever it takes to make Rhode Island's schools competitive with our neighbors and give every single one of our children a shot at a bright future -- no matter their background or their zip code.
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Now, this won't be easy, and we all have a role to play, at both the state and local level. We need the courage to set an ambitious plan and stick to it despite the inevitable challenges and controversies that will come our way. We need to get even more serious about addressing our lowest performing schools and implement the highest-quality curricula in every school across the state, similar to how they do it in Massachusetts. We need to support and empower teachers so they can do their best work."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And I want to thank the thousands of amazing teachers and educators who are working hard every day in the classroom, including Amy Thompson and Marie Quinn, third grade teachers for Varieur Elementary School in Pawtucket, who are here tonight with some of their students."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Change takes time and determination. States that have been successful, like Massachusetts, have stuck with the same strategy for 25 years. In Rhode Island, we've had a pattern of not sticking with an approach long enough to generate results. For years, we've bounced from test to test, until finally last year embracing what Massachusetts has consistently used for years. Tonight, I'm announcing an additional $30 million in school funding. This funding for local communities is the single biggest increase of any part of the state budget."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,Let's all step up and make the necessary changes to improve student performance.
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Standing with parents and working with our dedicated teachers, we won't stop until all children can get the education they need for a bright future."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"To ensure every child is set up for success, we need to start before they get to kindergarten. We know that kids who go to high-quality preschool are more likely to graduate high school, more likely to get a good job and keep a good job, and less likely to commit a crime. Investments in Pre-K can save us money in the long-run because more Rhode Islanders will enjoy the economic benefits of a fulfilling life with a good job. In my first term, we tripled the number of public Pre-K classes and expanded all-day kindergarten to every district in the state, giving thousands of our littlest learners the right start in life. It's time to do more."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Tonight, I pledge to be the Governor who brings universal public Pre-K to Rhode Island. By the time I leave office, there will be a Pre-K seat for every four-year-old whose parents want it. The budget I'll submit later this week sets us on a path to make that happen. Let's get this done."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"During the last recession, three out of every four jobs lost were jobs that only required a high school degree. But nearly every job created since then has gone to people with a certificate or degree beyond high school. In fact, 99 percent of the jobs created since the end of the recession have gone to people with a certificate or degree beyond high school."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,There is nothing more important to the future of Rhode Island -- to the economic security of our friends and our family -- than making sure that everybody has the credential or degree they need to get a good job in today's economy. The most important factor businesses today look at when they expand is the education and talent level of the local workforce.
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Given this new reality, four years ago, we changed the way we do job training. We're partnering more closely with businesses to make sure that we're training people for jobs that actually exist. We're also transforming CCRI into a workforce development engine. Our approach is helping young people who are just starting out and Rhode Islanders in the middle of their careers. Already, thousands of Rhode Islanders have gotten good jobs and other states are looking at us as a model for how to do effective job training. Our goal is to provide job training to any Rhode Islander who wants it. The budget I submit this week will make it easier for adults to earn a degree at CCRI, and it expands Real Jobs RI, guaranteeing job training and apprenticeships for thousands more Rhode Islanders."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Two years ago, we took an historic step and made community college tuition-free for every high school graduate. Since then, the percentage of students on-track to graduate on time has nearly quadrupled. Enrollment has doubled. And I can't go a week without meeting a parent or a student who stops me to say that the Rhode Island Promise scholarship has changed their family's lives."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Tuition-free community college is one of the lowest-cost, highest-impact investments the State of Rhode Island has ever made. So, this year I propose an expansion of Rhode Island Promise to make the last two years of a four-year degree at Rhode Island College tuition-free."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Too many students start at RIC, but can't finish because they can't juggle a full course load and two or three jobs to cover tuition. The number one reason students drop out is cost. Most RIC graduates stay in Rhode Island. They're our teachers, our nurses, our IT technicians that keep our economy going. This small but smart investment -- a few million dollars in a $10 billion budget -- will change lives, strengthen our economy and help us fulfill our obligation to ensure that every Rhode Islander can get a good job. If we do this, Rhode Island College will arguably offer the most affordable four-year degree in America. Let's lead the way."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And before these four years are done, let's bring Promise to our state's flagship university, the University of Rhode Island."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"To build an economy that includes every Rhode Islander, we also need to do more to propel the working poor into the middle class. Across our state, tens of thousands of people work full time, some working two or three jobs, struggle to make ends meet. Since I've been Governor, we've raised the minimum wage three times. In the budget I submit this week, I will propose another minimum wage increase to $11.10 to keep us on pace with Massachusetts and Connecticut and put us on a pathway to a $15 minimum wage."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"No one who works full time should live in poverty. Work should have dignity, it should provide stability, it should give purpose."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Our new approach to economic development is creating thousands of jobs, and we can't take our foot off the gas. Companies big and small are growing here, hiring Rhode Islanders and making investments. We need to continue to make it easier and cheaper to do business in Rhode Island."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"When I first started as Governor, most other states had a small business loan fund. But we didn't. So, we started one. It provides loans to small companies -- the neighborhood bakery that outgrew its first kitchen, the local shop where you can buy a communion dress for your daughter or granddaughter. Here in Rhode Island, small business is big business. Over the last four years, 75 small businesses have gotten one of these loans, and they've added hundreds of new jobs and added millions to our economy. Last year, we set a goal to double the number of small business loans awarded. We hit that goal. So, tonight I say, let's double it again."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And while we are supporting our local businesses, let's remain open to new investment, new industries, and new companies. Cynicism has long been one of our worst enemies, and I'm proud that we've stood strong against cynicism. I'm even prouder of the results. Over the last four years, nearly 30 companies have moved here or expanded here because of our economic development initiatives. Those companies are creating thousands of jobs that pay on average $65,000 a year."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Thousands of Rhode Island families like Nafissa Hassan's have economic security because of it. Two years ago, she was in a low-paying job with no opportunity to grow. She enrolled in a Real Jobs IT training program and got an internship with eMoney, a global company we brought to Rhode Island because of our new business programs. Today, Nafissa is an associate engineer at eMoney earning a good, family-supporting paycheck. And she promises me that she's not done climbing."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"A healthy economy also requires a healthy workforce. No one can be a good employee or do well in school if they aren't healthy. And no one should go bankrupt because of medical bills or panic when their kid gets sick because they can't afford the bill. The Affordable Care Act is working in Rhode Island. It's working better here than in nearly every other state. Since I've been Governor, we've cut our uninsured rate by roughly half, nearly all Rhode Islanders have health insurance, and health insurance premiums on our exchange are some of the lowest in America."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,But Washington's constant attacks on the ACA put all of that at risk. Rhode Islanders with pre-existing conditions and thousands of families who count on the ACA for coverage have a target on their back. We have to take action to protect them and preserve their health care. Let's pass legislation this year that protects the Affordable Care Act in Rhode Island. And let's take steps to lower premiums and reduce insurance costs for people and small businesses.
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And while we are talking about health care, let's make this the year we codify women's access to reproductive health care here in Rhode Island."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"If we fail to protect health care, our economic recovery will be on life support."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And again this year, I am asking that we continue to be a national leader in expanding access to mental health care for all Rhode Islanders. Last year, I met privately with small groups of teachers to ask them what it's like to be an educator in America today. In every single meeting, the number one concern they raised was their students' mental health. If our kids are going to succeed and reach the high standards we have for them, then we really need to meet all of their needs today."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"This year, we will launch a new initiative to address mental health in our schools. We're going to make sure that kids can have access to health care for their anxiety and depression just as they do for a broken arm or the flu. The budget I'll introduce this week will also include funding to provide educators with the training they need to support their students' mental health needs. Today's kids are struggling with mental health issues far more than we did. And as a mom, I can see why. We didn't grow up with the pace or pressure or technology our kids have today."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"And sadly, our kids are growing up in a country where they have to worry about gun violence. Across the country, 100 people are killed every day by a firearm. And since 2015, I've ordered our flags to half-mast 13 times because of a mass shooting. The plague of gun violence is one of the most disturbing and preventable public health crises of this generation. Last year, we passed a red flag law and banned bump stocks. And I'm deeply thankful to the legislature and advocates for your help to get that done. But we didn't finish our work. This year let's ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and let's ban guns in schools."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"It's time. We can't sit back and deny a generation of Rhode Islanders their right to safe schools and safe communities. Later this month, I will submit a comprehensive package of gun safety reforms that we know will save lives. Rhode Islanders overwhelmingly support stronger gun laws. Let's pass these bills this year."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"In the end, our efforts to strengthen gun laws, to end the overdose crisis, to protect health care, to expand job training, to support businesses and provide our children with a world class education are all about one thing: the future."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"We can profoundly shape and strengthen the state we pass down to our kids. The decisions we make, the actions we take, the tone we use, all have the potential to be lasting and impactful."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,"Years from now, we'll look at the state that we've passed down to our children. If, and only if, we've made good on our promise to leave no one behind; If, and only if, we've actually delivered economic opportunity for all; If, and only if, Rhode Island is the place where if you work hard you really can get ahead ... Then -- and only then -- can we say we were successful."
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,I think we're up for it.
Rhode Island,Gina Raimondo,Democrat,Thank you. God bless you. And God bless Rhode Island.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you all for being here tonight, those in this magnificent building as well as those watching from afar."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I am proud of our state and I am also proud of my family. For those who have not met them, please let me introduce my wife, Peggy and my son Henry and his wife Virginia. We all live in Columbia. My daughter, Mary Rogers, is watching from New York with her fiancé, Samuel Martin Herskovitz. The big date:  March 16. Will you please stand be recognized? Thank you."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"One year ago, I observed that we were at the dawn of a new prosperity, that our future would be even better than our past."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Tonight, as we all know, it is true. The state of our state is strong – and getting even stronger. We live in a land of opportunity. And over the generations we have built the institutions of opportunity. Our goals today must be to re-invigorate and accelerate those institutions and rededicate ourselves to achieving the prosperity which can be ours. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We have a strong state because we are strong people. A family, a state, a nation is only as strong as its people. Our strength is an economic issue and also an issue of national security. In a rapidly changing world – a highly competitive and dangerous world – we must be constantly making our people strong.  Educated. Trained. Healthy. Happy."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"As I speak tonight, I would like to recognize just a few of our strong people. Leaders who have made a difference in our lives. I start with the six in uniform who lost their lives while protecting ours."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Deputy Shannon Dale Hallman of the Saluda County Sheriff’s Office;
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Deputy James L. Kirk, Jr. of the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office;"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Sergeant Terrance F. Carraway of the Florence Police Department;
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Deputy Farrah B. Turner of the Florence County Sheriff’s Office;
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Assistant Fire Chief Dennis Charles Straight of the Charlotte Road/Van Wyck Volunteer Fire Department in Lancaster County; and
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Sergeant First Class Christopher A. Celiz, United States Army, who lost his life in Paktia Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"To the families and loved ones of these men and women, on behalf of all South Carolinians, we send you love, admiration and strength, and we thank you for your loved ones’ service and sacrifice.  You are in our prayers."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I would also like to thank Dr. Harris Pastides, who is retiring after ten years of remarkable leadership and accomplishment at the University of South Carolina, who is with us tonight. Dr. Pastides, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Not with us tonight is Dr. Andrew Hsu, whom we welcome as the new president of the College of Charleston.  He has called this position his “American Dream.”"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"And also, I’d like to congratulate Clemson University on winning their third national championship."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"In many different ways, all of these men and women have added to the strength and prosperity of our state."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,And I have one brand new face for you:  Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette of Travelers Rest with her husband David and son Jackson. Thank you for accepting the call to serve our fellow citizens.  Please stand and be recognized.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, South Carolina is red hot."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Our agricultural base is accelerating, our tourism industry is thriving, and we have become a major high-tech manufacturing hub. South Carolina is the nation’s top exporter of tires and of completed automobiles. Our average annual manufacturing employment growth is 16%, the highest in the southeast. Over and over we are recognized as one of the best places in the country to do business and to visit or vacation."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"In the last two years, we have announced over $8 billion dollars in new capital investment and more than 27,000 new jobs. Our unemployment rate just hit an all-time low. More people are working than ever before."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"In the past year we have welcomed many new businesses to South Carolina and celebrated the growth, expansions and milestones with those who already call our state home. Some of them are here with us tonight.  I’ll ask them to stand and we’ll welcome as a group."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing W International, Mr. Ed Walker and Ms. Michelle Fowler"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing Kent International and Bicycle Corporation of America, Mr. Arnold Kamler and Mr. Scott Kamler"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing DRÄXLMAIER Group, Mr. Bradley Nelson and Mr. Chip Vogel"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing Keurig Dr. Pepper, Mr. Randy Downing and Ms. Pam Daskalakis"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing Sonoco, Mr. Rob Tiede and Mr. Roger Schrum"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing Google, Mr. Paul Carff"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Representing RoundPoint Mortgage, Mr. Kevin Brungardt"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to this historic State House."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Did you notice at the Inauguration ceremony two weeks ago – on the steps – in addition to the display of leadership of our academic establishment, the presence of 27 diplomats from 22 countries? These visitors are here for one reason:  Commerce.  Investment.  Prosperity. They see that we are on the way up."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"They know that we have recognized and are harnessing the catalytic power of collaborations between and among business and industry and academia. In a word, it is brainpower. Brainpower produces commercial horsepower. And that horsepower drives our economic prosperity."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, we in South Carolina are players in the greatest economic competition the world has ever known. We must be bold, aggressive and think long-term. We must keep the people and institutions of South Carolina leading the competition."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,It has taken years to get to where we are. But we must do more.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"That means we must keep taxes low, reduce burdensome regulations and invest heavily in infrastructure."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,We have the highest marginal income tax rate in the southeast – the 12th highest in the nation. Seven states have no income tax at all. Taxes of all kinds at all levels add up – little by little – to smother growth.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Beating the competition requires reforming our state’s marginal income and corporate tax rates. That’s why I have proposed a $2.2 billion tax cut across all personal income brackets resulting in an average 15% rate reduction.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"And that’s why I commend the House and Senate for embarking on a comprehensive effort to reform our state’s tax structure. Working together, I am certain that we will succeed and keep South Carolina winning!"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"This year, our vigorous economy created a budget surplus. My executive budget sends $200 million of this surplus back to South Carolina taxpayers in the form of a one-time rebate check. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Surpluses don’t mean we have to spend it all. A surplus allows us to prioritize the most critical needs in state government and then return the rest to the taxpayers!
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We should commit to returning tax dollars back to our state’s businesses at every opportunity. Last year, I issued a $52 million dollar cut to the unemployment insurance taxes paid by our state’s employers. This was made possible by the leadership and work done by many in this room tonight to reform and rebuild our state’s trust fund."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"The time has come to re-double our commitment to our state’s men and women in uniform - veterans, first responders, law officers, firefighters and peace officers – through a full retirement income exemption."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"The exemption for veterans is a key factor in the Pentagon’s decisions on protecting and expanding a state’s military bases and expanding and bringing new missions and troops to our bases. It’s also an effective incentive to keep experienced law officers, firefighters, and first responders on the job."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We are now another year into our ongoing state retirement pension crisis. Our unfunded pension liability threatens to place unprecedented strain on state government if we do not take action soon. Retired, current and future public employees must have a pathway to retirement income security, with future benefits and costs that are both sustainable and predictable. Doing nothing threatens our commitment."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,It is a fact that we have some of the strongest people in the country in the field of education.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"For example, in 2001, Dr. Sharon Buddin of Ridge View High School, and in 2009, the late Lucy Beckham of Wando High school were named National Principal of the Year. Last year, it was Dr. Akil Ross, of Chapin High School. This year, we celebrate again, with Dr. Lucas C. Clamp, of River Bluff High School, being recognized as National Principal of the year."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"They aren’t able to be with us here tonight, but we thank them for exemplifying the greatness that South Carolina produces."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Ladies and gentlemen: we are building an international reputation for business growth and progress. Being perceived as weak in any part of our state in education is not good. But being perceived as not committed to fixing it is disastrous.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Not long ago, I had a conversation with Dr. Wanda Andrews, the Superintendent of the Lee County School District. A rural county. Education suffers there. Once grown, children leave, only returning for a family reunion or homecoming football game."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I asked Dr. Andrews what would happen if a new manufacturing plant offering 500 jobs were to come to her district. Dr. Andrews set down her pencil, took off her glasses and said, “it would change everything.”"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Dr. Andrews, that is exactly what we are going to do: change everything. The words “Corridor of Shame” will be a distant memory! Dr. Andrews, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"This will require a state-backed economic development commitment to bring jobs to these districts by providing infrastructure in rural areas – not only in water, sewer, and roads, but in school buildings and facilities. We must provide the spark."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,My executive budget creates the “Rural School District Economic Development Closing Fund.” This fund will provide $100 million dollars for our Department of Commerce to use as a “closing fund” to bring new jobs and investment to our poorest school districts.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We must also invest in our teachers. To attract and retain the best, their compensation must be competitive with their peers in the southeast and elsewhere. My executive budget calls for a 5% teacher pay raise totaling $155 million dollars. This will increase average teacher salaries above the southeastern average."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"But we can’t stop there. The primary funding formula for public education, the Education Finance Act, was established forty years ago. That and those that have followed have become outdated, inefficient, and confusing."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"They fail to provide the accountability, efficiency, and transparency necessary for a modern means of measurement, to determine if taxpayer dollars are being properly delivered and utilized in the classroom."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Last week, Speaker Lucas and President Peeler and I called on the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office to objectively review South Carolina’s complex education funding formulas and suggest a new, more efficient and modern funding model for the General Assembly to consider. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Further, Speaker Lucas and Senator Greg Hembree will propose wholesale reforms to our education delivery system – eliminating burdensome testing, consolidating school districts, replacing non-productive school boards and reigning in the practice of social promotions in our classrooms. I support the Speaker and the Senator 100%. Send me these reforms and I will sign them into law. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,But we can’t stop there either.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Our classrooms and schools must also be safe, free from distraction and violence."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,It’s a fact: the presence of a trained certified law enforcement officer is the best and most effective deterrent against violence at a school.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Local police officers or sheriff’s deputies who serve as school resource officers are trained to spot, assess, and eliminate any potential threat. They train constantly. They immediately communicate and coordinate with local law enforcement."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Last year, we held a school safety summit of law enforcement, educators, counselors, mental health professionals, parents, and students to address the rise of violence in our schools."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Two recommendations were made over and over. One was to place a school resource officer in every school. The second was to provide access to mental health professionals who can train educators to recognize the warning signs of violent behavior in their students before it happens.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Some school districts cannot afford such personnel. Therefore, my executive budget ensures that every public school in our state has a full-time, trained law enforcement officer and access to a mental health counselor through the Department of Mental Health’s school services program."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,The time to act on this is now.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"For decades, every family’s goal was for their children to go to college, which meant a four-year college degree. Higher education was – and still is – the key to success."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"But the industries have changed.  The skills required in today’s modern workplace require us to stay ahead of demand and adapt with rapid advancements in technology. Modern manufacturing plants and assembly lines have been transformed into intricate computerized environments driven by advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and sophisticated logistical delivery systems designed to deliver finished products around the world."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,This economic prosperity can also be achieved today through two-year associate degrees and a multitude of certificates from our state’s technical colleges.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Our technical college system is the best in the country. Last year, our readySC program trained over 3,600 people for 82 companies. It is known around the world. My budget also triples existing funding for readySC, making more than $19 million dollars available for training new employees for business in the next fiscal year. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Right now South Carolina has 60,000 highly paid jobs looking for people. High tech production; advanced manufacturing. The demand for workers in the skilled trades – plumbing, masonry, carpentry, and others – high paying jobs – is so great that our businesses have to go out of state to recruit them."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,High school students and their parents must be made aware that these new opportunities are readily available. My executive budget prioritizes funding for our technical colleges to identify and recruit local businesses to participate in collaborative partnerships with high schools; to create internship opportunities; to promote certificate completion. This will provide our local businesses with a pipeline of future employees who are ready to work.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,My budget includes $63 million dollars in additional dollars that are dedicated to workforce training and development. It triples new lottery funding for workforce scholarships and grants – to help students attend our state’s technical colleges.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"But even with our growth, the cost and debt associated with higher education is becoming a barrier for many students and their families."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"With ten years of tuition and fee increases, student loan debt in South Carolina has risen by 315% - the highest increase in the country."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I am proposing a one-year freeze on tuition and fees for in-state students at our public technical colleges, four-year colleges and research universities for the 2019-2020 academic year."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,In exchange for freezing in-state tuition and fees – to be certified by the Commission on Higher Education – institutions will receive a 6% increase to their annual base budget. That will be their pro-rata share from a $36 million-dollar appropriation my budget makes to the CHE.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,I expect this one-year tuition freeze to serve as the first step toward a comprehensive reform of higher education funding and tuition.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Our state’s institutions of higher education play a vital role in our state’s economic prosperity. Their continued success is critical to keeping South Carolina competitive and winning.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We must also continue to invest in infrastructure. Our ports, roads, and rail are critical components of our economic prosperity."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"In December, the South Carolina Ports Authority reported a 6.4% year-over-year container volume growth, with a record 2.3 million units handled in 2018 that marked the third consecutive year of record volume. We’re only getting stronger."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"The deepening of Charleston Harbor is one of our most important steps to accelerate our future prosperity. Working with President Trump and his administration, and with the assistance of Senator Graham and our Congressional Delegation, last year we secured an additional $49 million dollars to keep the Charleston Harbor dredging on schedule. There is more to come. And remember, we wisely provided the first $300 million dollars several years ago to guarantee the fulfillment of the project."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Once this project is completed, Charleston will have the deepest, most efficient harbor on the Atlantic, allowing post-Panamax ships to carry even bigger loads in and out of South Carolina, spurring economic growth throughout the state."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"This is an enormous competitive advantage, and to it we will add in the years ahead, a revitalized Port of Georgetown and a new Port of Jasper."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I’d like to recognize Chairman Bill Stern and CEO Jim Newsome, of the South Carolina Ports Authority for their vision and dedication. Mr. Newsome couldn’t be with us tonight, but I’d like to ask Chairman Stern to stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,The elemental purpose of government is to protect people and property. Today we understand the many advantages of replacing recidivism with employment. We also know that more officers on the street means less crime.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"My executive budget provides more than $33 million dollars for law enforcement, corrections, probation, firefighting and other criminal justice agencies to use for pay raises, retention bonuses and hiring new officers. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"It also includes an additional $40 million dollars to the Department of Corrections to expedite security system upgrades and modernization, as well as critical repairs to damaged prison facilities."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,Director Bryan Stirling’s focus on workforce readiness among inmates has resulted in South Carolina having one of the lowest recidivism rates in the country. More former inmates are re-entering their communities with a job than ever before. South Carolina is a safer place because of Director Stirling’s leadership. He is one of the most innovative and effective directors of prison systems in the United States.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Director Bryan Stirling, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"The “silent hurricane” of opioid addiction continues to pummel the Palmetto State. The death toll from opioid-related overdose continued to rise in 2017, with 748 opioid-related fatalities across the state. There were just 57 in 2014."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Last year, I declared a statewide public health emergency, mobilizing the full power of the state’s emergency infrastructure in response to the growth of opioid addiction and abuse. And I signed what must be the most comprehensive set of laws in the country addressing this crisis across the spectrum of law enforcement, education, and healthcare."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"For instance, our doctors are now required to educate minors and their families on the dangers of opioids before prescribing them; DHEC is issuing tamper-proof prescription pads; the anti-overdose drug Narcan is more readily available; and initial prescriptions are now limited to seven days."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"I also established the Opioid Emergency Response Team, which in June released a plan consisting of recommendations on physical and public education, prevention and response, treatment and recovery, and law enforcement approaches."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Although there is still much to be done, this progress would not have happened without the leadership of our Director of the Department of Alcohol and other Drug Abuse Services. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Director Sara Goldsby, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"“A healthy mind in a healthy body” was the classical ideal; today it is a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, especially in some of our rural areas, access to good healthcare is lacking. But fortunately, we know how to fix it."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"As always, education and knowledge are essential to progress. But so is the convenient access to health care professionals. This can be done in two ways:  physical presence and virtual presence. We are doing both."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Last year, I signed the law repealing the restriction which required nurse practitioners to work only within 45 miles of their supervising physician. Now they can go anywhere. You are now seeing them in drug stores, rural clinics and soon – other convenient locations."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Virtual presence is accomplished by telehealth, in which we lead the nation."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"We are home of the Medical University of South Carolina, which is now designated a National Telehealth Center of Excellence – one of only two in the country. This recognition would not have been achieved without the General Assembly investing and prioritizing innovation and optimization in the areas of stroke care, obstetrics, mental health and urgent care."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Through telehealth, we can expand access to healthcare professionals, improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,And there is another kind of health which we must address. That is the health of the public’s confidence in their public servants and institutions. 
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"As we move forward together, we must reaffirm our commitment to good government. As elected officials, we are stewards of the public trust. South Carolinians must trust their representatives, and representatives must demonstrate they are deserving of that trust."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Maintaining the public’s trust in government, at all levels, requires transparency and accountability on how and why every single taxpayer dollar is spent."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,The best disinfectant against waste and corruption – or suspicions thereof – is sunshine. That means stronger and expanded authority for the State Ethics Commission
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Anyone paid to influence decisions made by state, county, municipal, or school board officials must be required to publicly register with the state ethics commission as a lobbyist. Public officials must be required to recuse themselves when a conflict exists. And public officials in all branches of government - at all levels - must comply with the Freedom of Information Act."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,I ask my colleagues to take this fresh opportunity to bring all of government into the sunlight and restore and insure the confidence of all.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"South Carolina’s bright economic future and continued job growth require an abundant supply of clean and affordable energy. Without it, we are at a competitive disadvantage."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"However, Santee Cooper is currently saddled with almost $9 billion dollars in debt, over $4 billion dollars of that debt from the failed VC Summer nuclear reactor construction project alone, with nothing to show for it."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"This huge debt will have to be paid. Santee Cooper will have no choice but to raise rates on customers to pay this debt. Their largest customer, the electric cooperatives, will be required to pay 70% of it for the next 30 years."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,I am honored to serve on the committee with members of the House and Senate to present potential solutions concerning the future of Santee Cooper. I ask that members of the General Assembly keep an open and objective mind when you receive this information. We must be deliberate and wise.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"This land, as noted by explorers for kings and queens, is lush, fertile and brimming with abundance in plant and animal life. It is irreplaceable. The obligation and privilege of our generation and others to use it, cultivate it, develop it and also to protect it and encroach upon it only gently."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Our economic growth and the preservation of our natural environment are not opposing objectives which must be balanced as in a competition, one against the other. Instead, they are complimentary, each dependent on the other."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"To these ends, I recently established the South Carolina Floodwater Commission. It is unique in the United States. The commission’s purpose is to provide guidance, solutions and opportunities presented by inland and coastal flooding and all that entails. Its scope will be global, to be applied here."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Such an effort requires extraordinary leadership. That is why I have asked another South Carolina leader to chair the commission. Noted attorney, former JAG officer and former commander of the South Carolina State Guard, General Tom Mullikin, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Economic prosperity requires that we address water in a comprehensive fashion – whether it is flooding, sea rise, aquifer depletion, or upstream withdrawal. Make no mistake – a plentiful water supply is essential to our manufacturing, agricultural and tourism industries as well as our quality of life. "
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"That means that we must stand firmly against all efforts to endanger the future of our pristine coastline, our beaches, our sea islands, our marshes, and our watersheds."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, that means we will not have offshore testing or drilling off the coast of South Carolina."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,One final story about strong people.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"For two and a half days last September, Hurricane Florence stormed across North and South Carolina – battering the coast with hurricane force winds, storm surge, and massive amounts of rainfall."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"The winds were less than originally predicted; the water was many times worse. That rainfall sent almost Biblical amounts of water racing into and onto South Carolina, creating catastrophic flooding along the Lynches, Great Pee Dee, Little Pee Dee and Waccamaw Rivers, surpassing anything recorded in modern history. It stayed there for weeks."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Access to the Grand Strand was threatened by historic, rising floodwaters poised to overtake, washout and destroy the roads and bridges into Myrtle Beach, and they did. In addition, the threat of an environmental catastrophe was now on our doorstep with the certain over-topping of the closed Santee Cooper ash pond on the edge of the Waccamaw in Conway. Thus, began a remarkable feat of cooperation, engineering, science, hydrology, technology and collaboration. Four foot tall barriers were built on both sides of US 501 at Conway, saving that vital highway from certain flooding and breech. A four foot aqua-dam was erected surrounding the eight-acre ash ponds to keep potentially deadly coal ash and toxins from flowing into the Waccamaw River and the Winyah watershed, all the way to Georgetown. And potential breeches along US 378 and state highway 9 were blunted."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,The participants? The men and women of the Department of Transportation and the South Carolina National Guard.
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Secretary Christy Hall and Major General Bob Livingston, please stand and be recognized."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"In closing, to my friends and colleagues in the General Assembly:"
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"All of us in this building do not wear the same jerseys, but we are still on the same team. We will work together to ensure that future generations of South Carolinians are able to keep winning and prospering."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"Now is the time to be bold, not bashful. Now is the time to act together. This year. Now."
South Carolina,Henry McMaster,Republican,"May God bless you, the great state of South Carolina, and the United States of America."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Lieutenant Governor Rhoden, Mr. Speaker, members of the legislature, Chief Justice Gilbertson, Justices of the Supreme Court, constitutional officers, and fellow South Dakotans. It is my privilege to stand before you today to discuss the state of our state."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Just 14 days ago, we turned the page not only on a new calendar year, but also on a new decade. And today, we kick-off a new legislative session. Last year, we found so many ways to work together to give greater freedoms to our people, promote our outdoor heritage, and restrict the endless expansion of government into our daily lives. This year, it is my hope that we will find even more opportunities to work together – advancing commonsense solutions to the problems we can solve on behalf of the people of this great state."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,One of the things I was taught as a kid was that you don’t just complain about things; you work to fix them.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"And as this year’s session starts, we must keep in mind that we are looking, not just at the short term, but at the long term too."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Fifty-nine years ago, almost to the day, President Eisenhower, in his farewell address, warned the nation to avoid the impulse of living only for today. He spoke candidly about how wrong it would be to mortgage the future of our grandchildren because it would lead to the loss of their political and spiritual heritage. He said, “We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.”"
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"As you may recall in my inaugural address, I told you about my desire to be a governor for the next generation. The north star that guides my every decision is the impact a policy, a piece of legislation, or program will have, not only on South Dakotans today, but also on the next generation."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I grew up with a Dad who dreamed of all four of his kids being able to stay on the family ranch if they wanted to. My vision for South Dakota is the same. We must ensure that every South Dakotan can build their life here and make a good living, so they can provide for their families and maintain our traditions and way of life. This is why I am committed to four pillars of protection for South Dakotans: keeping taxes low, limiting government regulation, fighting government intrusion, and keeping government open and honest."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"With a year under our belt, I’m proud to stand before you and say we accomplished a lot in 2019, and we did it all without raising taxes and without spending more than we took in. And unlike Illinois, New York, and many other states, we are seeing a net increase in our population. Why? Because Americans are looking for the opportunities that present themselves in states that encourage self-government like we do here in South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"And to all the business prospects we’ve been recruiting, I’d like to make the case here and now about why you should join us in South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Anyone who has spent time here realizes what great people we have in South Dakota - our work ethic and values are second to none.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,We don't have a corporate income tax. And there’s also no business inventory tax.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"For our hard-working residents, we are one of the few remaining states with no personal income tax - and I am committed to keeping it that way."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,We don't burden our citizens with a personal property tax or an inheritance tax.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"The taxes that we do have to fund state government are stable and predictable. In addition to my commitment to not raising taxes, our constitution requires a 2/3rd vote in both chambers to raise taxes. In short, if you’re worried about tax increases, you needn’t be – your business is safe here."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Government in South Dakota lives within its means. We balance our budget without accounting gimmicks or tricks.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I'm proud of our AAA credit rating, and our state pension plan is fully funded. That means businesses that move here don't need to worry about surprise charges, fees, or taxes to make up for an unfunded pension plan like our neighbors in Illinois."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In South Dakota, we believe in smart regulation. We roll out the red carpet, not the red tape."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Our part-time legislature is one of just a few that is a true citizen legislature. Our legislators come to Pierre, tackle the problems that need to be tackled that session, and then go home to their jobs, their families, and their communities."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Our state parks and outdoor recreational opportunities are second to none. There's a reason we are the pheasant capital of the world.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I have traveled all across this country and around the world, and I can tell you, there is no better place to operate a business and raise a family than in South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"For employers and employees alike, my goal is to make sure folks across the country and around the world know that South Dakota is THE PLACE to do business. Whether you’ve owned and operated a business for four generations, or you’re looking to start or even relocate your current operation, I want my message to be crystal clear: South Dakota is OPEN for business."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In the next few minutes, I’m going to walk you through some of the specifics of what we were able to accomplish this last year and what we’re looking to do in 2020 and beyond."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"A priority of my administration has been to open up South Dakota’s government and make it more accountable, more accessible, and the most transparent it has ever been. It was Thomas Jefferson who said the whole art of government is honesty. He was right. A government that cannot be trusted by the people is no longer serving one of the primary purposes of government: to preserve the blessings of liberty."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,We have taken many steps over the past year to advance this important goal.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"As I highlighted in the budget address, we expanded the capabilities of Open.SD.Gov."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"We took to heart the importance of fact-based reporting as a key component of holding government accountable, so I asked for a reporter shield law and – together – we got that done."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"We took advantage of free technology like YouTube and Facebook Live to bring information directly into the living rooms of South Dakotans. And we are currently working with the Municipal League and local governments to find a way to get their meeting materials online like we do at the state level. In other words, we are making participation in government easier for every South Dakotan, and modern communications tools are incredibly helpful to open government in a state as large as ours."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"It is my desire to be the most connected governor the state has ever seen. This includes bringing my administration to every corner of the state and advocating for our great state all across the country. Over the course of this first year, we held official events in nearly 30 counties. I sat down and strategized with hundreds of business leaders. I have visited with teachers, soldiers, farmers and ranchers. And, at the request of the Department of Tourism, I helped promote South Dakota’s brand and footprint throughout the nation and globally at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,My team is also working to provide our communities – even the most remote ones – the tools they need to be connected.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In America’s early days, mail was delivered via post road. The Founders thought communication was so important to the business of the people and the nation that they included a provision in the Constitution to allow for the government to establish post roads. Well today, in the modern economy, technology allows for the transportation of goods and services by way of a whole different kind of post road – the internet. We want to create an environment where people aren't forced to choose between the modern economy on the one hand, and life in their hometowns on the other. We must make sure our people can harness the latest technology to take advantage of what has become the modern equivalent of a post road."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Along those lines, I stood before you last year and told you we needed to set goals as a state to bring our homes and businesses up to a satisfactory level of broadband access. I outlined a plan to do so, so that more South Dakotans than ever before could be connected to high-speed internet. I told you we couldn’t do this alone – that we had to bring industry leaders to the table to help us identify our gaps and outline a plan to bridge them."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Let me provide you with an update on where things stand today.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In March, you approved $5 million dollars to be used as matching funds for broadband improvement. The Connect South Dakota program, which launched in May, brought in a total of $12.2 million dollars."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Because the state now has a plan in place, South Dakota companies have been awarded additional points on their applications for USDA Reconnect grants. This is a federal program that provides funding for telecommunications updates. In December, this federal program awarded another $9.5 million dollars in high-speed broadband infrastructure that will create or improve connectivity for more than 1,750 homes in rural South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Combined, that means our $5 million dollars has resulted in a $25 million investment in underserved areas – touching 6,500 homes and nearly 150 businesses."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Let me tell you two stories about this work.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In March of last year, we received a letter from a young couple, the Johnson family. They had recently built a new home in the rural area east of Dell Rapids. They built their home on farm land that has been in the family for five generations. They had all the latest technology – smart switches, smart alarms, smart thermostats – technology that would provide greater convenience and, in some cases, even insurance discounts. But there was one problem… they couldn’t use any of it because they didn’t have broadband access. They didn’t have what they needed for their career, their business, or their kids’ school work. One line from the letter that still sticks with me today is “Our daily struggles due to lack of broadband seem so ridiculous in a time when everything relies on being connected.”"
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"There’s also the story of the Linderman family. John and Patty own the only grocery store in Timber Lake, on the Cheyenne River Reservation. The next nearest grocery story is 40 miles. They didn’t have high-speed internet either. For them, that meant they couldn’t provide their customers with credit card, debit card, or WIC and EBT payment options. They even had to do all their orders for the store somewhere else. As you can guess, they lost a lot of business. But for Patty and John, they were most heartbroken about sending away those with WIC purchases."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Fast forward to the end of last year, thanks to the work of GOED, the Johnson family and Linderman business are now connected to high-speed internet."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"The great news is that there are 6,500 more Johnson families out there and more than 150 business’ like the Lindermans. The rural life is their preferred way of life. They want to stay on the land their grandfathers and grandmothers once farmed. They want to stay in the communities they call home. These choices should not stop them from being connected to basic technologies like high-speed internet."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"While $5 million didn’t fix our broadband gap overnight, it was a very strong start. More needs to be done. My hope is that we can continue to work together this legislative session to address more of our high-speed internet needs."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I started out my speech with at least 10 reasons why it’s great to live and work in South Dakota. And as we focus on economic progress, let me give you some good news."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Since my budget address, revenues have been slightly better than expected. What this means is that we may have extra flexibility to achieve the things we want to accomplish. My number one priority with additional, on-going money will be to provide increases to K-12 schools, providers, and state employees."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In order to do this for many years to come, we must work together to find ways to grow our state’s economy. With our eyes fixed to the future, we can ensure that every South Dakotan can build their life here, get good jobs, make a living and support their families."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Over the last year, I sat down with hundreds of business leaders across our state and across the country. I listened to their ideas, needs, and concerns. And I outlined where I would like our state to go this year as well as into the future for the next generation."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"One of the bright spots in our state’s economy over the last decade has been tourism. Despite tough weather and an up and down economy during that time, tourism has remained strong in the face of challenges and has continued to deliver good results year after year."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,This is no small accomplishment.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"The tourism industry has achieved nine straight years of record growth, reaching new levels of visitors, spending, and overall impact on our state’s economy. It is truly a revenue-generating, job-creating sector for South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In 2019, tourism activity directly supported more than 37 thousand jobs and 55 thousand jobs in total. This is 8.8 percent of all jobs in the state – 1 out of every 11."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Secretary Hagen has shared with me that despite the flooding and adverse weather we faced statewide in 2019, overall, the initial data his department has received is more encouraging than expected. We will be sharing more about this next week."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In addition to those efforts, let me outline some of the other things we’ve been working on to grow the economy last year and update you on what we’re hoping to do in 2020."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"One important and emerging sector is cybersecurity. We all know that the threat of a cyber-attack is an increasing concern to individuals, businesses, and governments in every corner of the globe. In May 2019, the Economic Development Administration awarded a $1.46 million-dollar grant to Dakota State University to help establish a high-speed research network. Because it is designated as an Opportunity Zone, the investment will receive a $1.46 million-dollar match in local funds."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,For the EDA to invest its money into Dakota State is monumental. It’s our academic leader in cybersecurity and it has been designated a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations by the National Security Agency.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"As I’ve said before, I want to emphasize that we have a great opportunity to capitalize on world-class talent coming out of DSU. We have a chance to lead the nation in cybersecurity. We must remember to train not only this workforce, but also to attract or create new companies here in South Dakota. Let’s keep our graduates, at home, with great jobs and a way of life they love."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Of course, we all know that agriculture is the foundation of our state's economy, and we need to find ways to strengthen and broaden our ag industry."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"There’s no question last year was a hard year for our farmers. But when times get tough, our people stand together. South Dakotan farmers pressed on."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Fortunately, 2020 looks to be different. Last month, we received the fantastic news that President Trump completed Phase One of a historic trade agreement with China. This new agreement is a win for South Dakota producers."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Knowing first-hand the relentless effort that is needed to negotiate trade deals, I have a deep appreciation for our President’s leadership and commitment to mend the U.S-China trade relationship."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I'm traveling to Washington to join President Trump at the White House as he signs this important agreement tomorrow. And I won't be going alone; I've asked Jerry Schmitz, a South Dakota soybean producer, and Craig Andersen, a South Dakota pork producer, to join me. We will all be there as the President locks in this new agreement and opens up new opportunities for South Dakota ag products."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In 2019, we expanded our ag focus to three key areas: precision ag, production ag and value-added ag."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,South Dakota counties that are interested in pursuing production ag or livestock development now have new opportunities. Our goal is to develop a lasting infrastructure devoted to agriculture for generations to come.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Over the next 10 years, private industry, South Dakota State University, the School of Mines and Technology, and the state will partner to support research and development in bioprocessing. We must invest in the future of ag in our state, diversifying operations for our farmers, ranchers, and timber producers. Our graduates will have a deeper understanding of how biofuels and agriculture can drive change across the globe."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Like cyber security, South Dakota is uniquely positioned to lead the nation in the development of bioprocessing, and I hope we can work together to support this initiative."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,There is another area where we are already a leader – South Dakota is the pheasant capital of the world. We know success often brings imitators. Other states are pursuing that title.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I stand before you today and call on every South Dakotan to get involved in the long-term preservation of our habitat. Pheasant hunting is a statewide tradition. For a century we have been the premier destination for hunters. And I want to make sure that title is ours in the century to come. With neighboring states trying to steal away our hunters, I’m calling on all of us to recognize this threat and join me in doing what it takes to improve and expand our habitat."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"We need to continue focusing on CRP efforts. We trapped 50 thousand predators this last year, and hopefully more people will find ways to participate in the Second Century Initiative. Though our efforts have just begun, I’m hearing from people all over the state that birds are more plentiful."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"I’m also pleased to announce that the bounty program we launched last year has been a success in more ways than one. Game, Fish, and Parks recently conducted a survey on South Dakotan’s perceptions of the bounty program and the results were overwhelmingly positive. We’re getting more people involved in trapping and the outdoors. Hunting, trapping, and shooting are great American traditions, fundamental to the culture and success of our state. These traditions help kids develop respect for nature, for property rights, as well as for other people."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"This year, Game, Fish, and Parks and the Department of Tourism will be partnering to not only ensure that people in South Dakota are enjoying their great outdoors, but also that we’re attracting others to come to our state and do the same."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"On a related note, in 2019, Game, Fish, and Parks began a pilot HuntSAFE program in schools across the state. The goal of the course is to teach students the responsible and safe handling of firearms as well as the values that come from being a true sportsman – values that should never be lost. We have 32 schools that are now certified to teach the program, up from just 8 schools in 2018. I’d love to see every school offer this program."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,I talk all the time about finding ways to build up our families and a big part of that is giving people access to the tools they need to be successful.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,Occupational licensing laws represent a burden. South Dakota is prepared to be an example of reform for the nation.
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Last year, I asked that Secretary Hultman at the Department of Labor and Regulation lead an extensive review of the 101 licenses required in South Dakota."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"Overall, South Dakota’s licensing system is in good shape, but there are many immediate actions we can take to further reduce burdens on our small business owners."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,"In the coming weeks, we will be taking several steps toward the goal of smart regulation, including simplifying licensing."
South Dakota,Kristi Noem,Republican,We will work to decrease wait time for license approval. We will find ways to increase transparency by requiring Advisory Committees to adhere to Open Meeting Laws. We will review the complaint and disciplinary processes for all boards and commissions. And we will identify opportunities to allow reciprocity.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Thank you very much.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Lieutenant Governor McNally, Speaker Sexton, Speaker Pro Tem Haile, Speaker Pro Tem Dunn, Members of the 111th General Assembly, Justices, Constitutional Officers, fellow Tennesseans:"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,It is an honor to once again be with you this evening.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Before I begin, Speaker Sexton, let me offer special congratulations to you on your election as Speaker."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I am looking forward to working with you during this session and in the years ahead as we make our state a leader in the nation.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, I stood at this podium, newly inaugurated as the 50th Governor of Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It has been a rewarding year, far more rewarding than I could have ever imagined."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To serve Tennesseans, to help make their lives better, to help give them a better education, to help recruit and create good jobs, and to help make our state a leader in the nation, it has been a humbling and truly honorable experience."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To serve with you, the men and women of the General Assembly, has been a tremendous honor as well."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Thank you for your support during my first year, it means an awful lot to Maria and to me."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"With all of the noise in our nation these days, whether it comes from Washington, or New York, or Hollywood, I can’t help but look across this room in Tennessee and be inspired."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Inspired by every man and woman in this chamber who sacrifices much and who is dedicated to their beliefs and to the service of their neighbors.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Thank you for what you do, and I look forward to working alongside each of you this session and in the years ahead."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Our state also has another dedicated servant here in this room tonight – our First Lady Maria Lee.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"She has been advocating tirelessly in the past year, launching her Tennessee Serves initiative and encouraging her fellow Tennesseans to join her in serving our neighbors."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"She’s hit the ground running, and Tennesseans have gotten to see what I’ve known for a long time."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Maria, I love you, and Tennessee is fortunate to have you as our First Lady."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"My family is here, and I’m especially glad to have my mother, Ann Lee, here tonight as well."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Thank you for being here.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As I begin tonight, I’d also like to thank my cabinet and my staff."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I am proud of you all and the high level of expertise and dedication that you lend to the people of Tennessee each day.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Thank you for your hard work - keep it going - Tennessee is counting on you.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Serving as your governor over the past year, I have seen a lot of good that we can be proud of."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In 2019, we were for the first time named the number one best fiscally managed state in the country."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’ve been named as the best business climate in the country.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re number one in the U.S. for advanced industry job growth and the best state for small business growth.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In the past year, this state has garnered 108 project commitments to create 16,500 jobs and $3.6 billion of capital investment in Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And while we still have more work to do on rural economic development, I’m also proud that more than half of these projects have been announced in rural counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, Mitsubishi, FedEx-Logistics, JNJ, Pilot.com, Hyosung, Amazon, Smile Direct, Icee, and dozens of other companies made expansions in or relocations to Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We are the envy of many states.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re not just being noticed by our fellow southern states – we’re gaining recognition from all across the country.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Over the last year, I visited every county in our state for the third time, and in every place I went, I saw Tennesseans working to make our state better."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Tonight, we gather to celebrate the state of our state and discuss ways to continue our momentum, but you and I know the successes we enjoy belong to the 6.8 million hard-working Tennesseans who sent us here."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We work for the people of Tennessee, and when you get back to your districts this weekend, you can tell your bosses, the people, this: I’ve seen it with my own eyes, the state of our state is healthy and strong. So, let’s work together to keep it that way."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I’m proud of what we accomplished together in our first year, and I’m excited about what’s to come."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In education, we made kids in our schools safer when we invested $30 million new dollars to support school safety and resource officers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As you know, we launched two major school choice initiatives this year as well."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Our first independent charter school authorizer will ensure quality oversight and accountability for our state’s public charter schools.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We created the Tennessee Education Savings Account Program, which will serve low-income students in districts with the highest number of low-performing schools."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Disruption is hard and sometimes controversial.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"But we cannot expect extraordinarily different outcomes without extraordinarily different inputs, so I’m proud of these initiatives, and I look forward to their success."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That said, the vast majority of our students are educated in traditional public schools, and the majority of our efforts must remain focused there."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Through my travels this year, I’ve been in dozens of schools from one end of Tennessee to the other."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I always learn something when I visit with students. But, when I visit with teachers, I’m inspired."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In this building, we work hard to develop student-centered education policies, but out there in the classrooms is where it happens."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We make it law, but teachers make it happen."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"No teacher I know does it only for the money, but you and I know a worker is worthy of their pay."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Teaching is a calling.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We know it is passion that brings teachers to the classroom, but we also know our teachers deserve to be paid more for the important work they do."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, I proposed, and you approved, more than $70 million to support increases in teacher salaries."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, I’m proposing the largest investment in K-12 teacher salaries in Tennessee history."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"My budget sets aside $117 million additional dollars for teachers, an amount equal to a 4% increase in the state’s contribution to teacher salaries."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We must also work harder to make teaching a more attractive profession for young people.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We know our new teacher numbers are dropping.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As our economy becomes more competitive for jobs, investing in workforce development must include developing the next generation of educators."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Over the next two years, we will recommend moving the minimum salary schedule for teachers from $36,000 to $40,000, so that no Tennessee teacher is making less than $40,000 per year."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,This change to the salary schedule will reward teachers across the state while also making the teaching profession even more appealing to young people considering the high call of becoming an educator.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, we'll apply to create an AP education teaching course and launch a new series of grants to support district ""Grow-Your-Own"" programs that support the development of a future teacher as early as high school."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We're also taking the “Grow-Your-Own” concept one step further.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"My budget includes $8.5 million to support the launch of the Governor's Teaching Fellowship, an initiative that will, in conjunction with Tennessee Promise, provide a college scholarship for over 1,000 of our best and brightest as they train to become teachers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"One of the reasons we’re making these investments is because, when it comes to educating our children, there may be nothing more important than recruiting, retaining, and training the best teachers in America in Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To our higher education leaders, I want to say thank you for the work you've put in these last several years to improve how we train the next generation of teachers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That's why our Department of Education will be working much more closely with our schools of education, to ensure that our approach to training teachers is the best in the nation."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In that spirit, I’m excited to announce a first of its kind competition to develop the best teacher preparation program in the world, right here in Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,The Tennessee Teacher and Leader Institute will solicit proposals from across the country to help launch a new initiative that will build the best educator preparation program in the nation.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Make no mistake: we will do whatever it takes to make Tennessee the best state in America to be a student, and that means making Tennessee the best state in America to be a teacher."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That means better pay, as we’ve said, but it also means better training and professional support, so that our teachers can perform at the top of their trade."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re investing $4 million to support professional development opportunities for school leaders and innovative career advancement opportunities for our best-performing teachers.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"One thing we hear from those teachers, is that many students arrive at school with a host of personal and family issues that classroom teachers don’t have the bandwidth to handle."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It creates a nightmare decision for the teacher - when a student is struggling, they can either stop the learning process for everyone else in the classroom to help the one student or ignore that student’s needs."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Indeed, our mental health challenges in schools are not just anecdotal."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,The data supports our concerns.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"One in five children has a mental health diagnosis in a given year, and over 60% of children who receive mental health services do so in schools."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"The youth suicide rate increased 56% in last decade, making it the second leading cause of death of young people age 10-24."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Scores of teachers and principals, as well as our education commissioner, have pleaded for reinforcements from the state to help schools tackle the mental health and other challenges that students bring with them into the classroom."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Tonight, that help is on the way."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"First, we're expanding the outreach capacity of our Department of Mental Health, growing our school-based behavioral health liaison program from 36 counties to all 95 counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Second, I'm proposing the creation of a new reserve: a K-12 Mental Health Trust Fund of $250 million in one-time funds to support the growth and placement of mental health support services in our most-at-risk schools."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We will seek private donations to grow the fund over time and use the earnings to make investments for years to come.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It is our expectation that Tennessee will lead the nation in bringing mental health support to our teachers and to our students, and we’re very proud of that."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In previous years, we've led the nation in other respects, particularly in student growth on our NAEP scores."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That achievement is due to the hard work of many in this room, as well as leaders who've come before us, and our hard-working teachers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Right now, our biggest academic challenge for our students is literacy."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Currently, only one-third of our third graders are reading on grade level."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Years later, this leads to nearly three out of four students who cannot read their high school level textbooks on the first day of school."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Literacy is the foundation for a student's educational journey.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And if we can’t get early childhood literacy back on track, all of our other investments and work in education will be limited."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, I'm recommending a new, comprehensive approach to literacy."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I'm introducing legislation to establish new, clearer standards for the training of new teachers and the development of current teachers, grounded in the evidence and science of reading, with proven methods like phonics-based instruction."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We will ensure adequate supports and interventions for students before they reach the critical third-grade milestone.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,But moving the needle on early childhood literacy requires more than talk - that’s why I’m also proposing an additional investment of $70 million to make sure teachers have what they need to accomplish the task at hand.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It’s a partnership with districts that will include improved materials, ongoing professional development, and high-quality instructional tools for teachers in the classroom."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Fully funding BEP growth, 4% teacher raises, the Tennessee Teacher and Leader Institute, record investments in teacher recruitment, professional development, literacy training, and the K-12 Mental Health Trust Fund, our total new dollars invested in the future of public education in the coming fiscal year will equal more than $600 million."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"So, when you’re back home in your districts this year, if someone tells you we’re not supporting public education, they’re not telling the truth."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re making these changes and these investments because we want our public schools to be excellent.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"But, how will we know if we’re succeeding?"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"On one hand, Tennessee moved up nine places on the NAEP in our best-performing area of math, and we avoided the national trend of backsliding on past gains."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"On the other hand, the true measure of a successful education system is a cohort of high school graduates who are well-prepared to be productive citizens, whether they choose a career or college."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To me, education isn't just about a test score."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Assessments are valuable tools, but if the adults in education are doing their job correctly, they won't just see academic statistics improve, they'll see the most important stat of all improve:"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That our students are prepared to become productive members of society, whether that's entering the workforce, attending college, or earning a high-quality industry credential."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This past year, we’ve placed special emphasis on career readiness."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I’m proud of the GIVE Act that this legislature approved last year, which allowed us to grant $25 million to schools across our state who are helping young adults earn industry certification earlier than ever before."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, we launched 28 new work-based learning programs, 18 of which are in rural distressed counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Some of my favorite days as governor have been traveling to this state’s rural counties to deliver a GIVE Grant to launch a new CTE program.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As I stand in a welding shop, I get to look into the eyes of students who, maybe for the first time, are excited about what they are doing at school."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I look at them and say, “You have a unique ability to connect your brain to your hands that a lot of students don’t have.”"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I tell them, “We need you. We need your skills. Your communities need you.”"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And I say to them, “Stay in your rural county, and build it. Put those gifts and skills to work in your own backyard. We need you.”"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I’m also proud of the Future Workforce Initiative, which is adding 100 new middle school STEM programs by 2022 and tripling the number of STEM-designated schools."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Through this work, we’ve seen a 100% increase in the number of schools applying to receive STEM-designation."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I'm also proud of our Department of Labor and Workforce Development, who in partnership with the Trump Administration has launched new investments in youth apprenticeships."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Our workforce cabinet members have done a great job this year.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For the first time, state agencies who are involved in workforce development are beginning to pull in the same direction, and their work is already paying off."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"The first outcome of that work will be next week’s launch of ApprenticeshipTN, a new effort that will realign our approach to getting individuals back into the workforce."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For those who do take advantage of our state’s excellent higher education system, we want to make sure that high-quality facilities and standards await them to give them the best possible chance of success."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last week, the Higher Education Commission released an update to our state's five-year Master Plan, shifting the focus from degrees to jobs."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We're moving forward with bold new goals such as increasing by 10% the number of dual enrollment students and increasing by 20% the number of Tennessee degrees in computer science and data analytics.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In addition to large investments in our salary pool and our outcomes-based funding formula, I’ve set aside nearly $160 million for capital improvements and $70 million for capital maintenance projects on our college campuses."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For the time being, we must continue to produce highly skilled workers as fast as we can on whatever track, so that we can keep feeding the tremendous job growth that we’ve seen across Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, I met with CEOs and business leaders in Silicon Valley, South Korea, and many places in between who are looking to invest in Tennessee because of the low-tax, conservative approach to government we've developed."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As I mentioned, more than 16,000 jobs have been created across Tennessee over the last year, but too few of them have been in our distressed and at-risk counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,That’s why I've instructed the Department of Economic and Community Development to raise the stakes when it comes to recruiting industry to rural areas.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I’ve directed ECD to restructure our incentive package to companies considering locating in our 15 distressed counties and 24 at-risk counties.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Speaking of our 15 distressed counties, with us tonight are the mayors from those counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Please stand and be recognized - I’m proud you’re here.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For the last several years, our strong economy has been feeding a very healthy budget, and the leaders in this room should be commended for their good stewardship."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Conservative principles work, and as I enter my second year as governor, I pledge to you to continue to lead our state in the direction of conservative fiscal management."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As you know, I asked each of our departments for a 1% budget cut last year, and they responded with cuts totaling 1.7% - $91 million trimmed from our state budget."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"A few months ago, I traveled to New York with our constitutional officers and Speaker Sexton to meet with bond rating agencies, sharing our story of fiscal responsibility and consistent results."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"They rewarded our collective effort once again with a Triple-A bond rating from all three rating agencies, one of only 13 states to achieve this."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Indeed, our economy is strong, and a rising tide lifts all boats."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It’s only fair that when the state is fiscally healthy, some of that money be returned to the taxpayer."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Tonight, I am announcing a proposal to cut the professional privilege tax in half and return $40 million to individuals and small business owners who every year pay this arbitrary and unfair tax."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Indeed, the state is seeing strong economic times, but many of our local governments are struggling financially, and we certainly don’t want to see any local tax increases."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In many of the counties I have visited throughout the past year, community leaders almost always tell me about projects or initiatives that could transform their counties, if only they could find funding."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And certainly, on many issues, local government knows better than we do how to direct resources."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For that reason, my budget proposal recommends $100 million for local government grants to be divided among every county and every municipality across our state."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This money can be used for one-time expenses such as road projects, I.T. upgrades, capital maintenance, utility system upgrades, and public safety projects."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, we made the largest single contribution in our state’s history to our Rainy-Day Fund, bringing the total to $1.1 billion."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Very few states have minimal debt and a growing Rainy-Day Fund, and this year we propose making an additional $50 million contribution, which is 20% more than the statutory requirement."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Even as we save for a rainy day in Nashville, we know that not all parts of our state are seeing the same successes."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,You might have heard that rural Tennessee is a priority of mine.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"My first executive order focused the attention of state government on rural areas, and later I gathered my cabinet in Perry County for the first-ever Governor’s Rural Opportunity Summit where we met with leaders from each of our distressed counties."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We invested $20 million in my first budget for broadband expansion to increase services in rural areas that need it most, and this year I am pleased to recommend an additional $25 million investment."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Maria, maybe this will be the year we finally get broadband on the farm."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I'm also recommending $20 million for ECD's Rural Opportunity Fund, which supports site development, main-street development, and critical infrastructure assistance."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We expanded an incentive program in Tennessee medical schools that will grow the pipeline of primary care doctors locating in rural communities.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, we plan to do even more for rural Tennessee."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re adding more than $4 million for payment increases to rural health clinics and expanding rural access to dental care through the Department of Health and a new public-private partnership with SmileTN.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re adding $7 million to the Ag Enhancement program and an additional $2 million for UT Extension Agents in distressed rural counties.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"The Department of Tourism has created an Office of Rural Tourism, and we’ve set aside nearly $2.4 million for their efforts to draw attention to beautiful parts of Tennessee that are off the beaten path."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We’re making these investments because, as our state’s elected leaders, we must remain aware of serving every part and every person of our state."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"That’s why I’ve made criminal justice reform such a large priority, because every person in Tennessee wants and deserves to live in a safe neighborhood."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"When properly implemented, criminal justice reforms save taxpayer dollars, shrink the size of government, properly punish wrongdoers, and make our communities safer."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, we gave correctional officers a long-overdue pay raise to make Tennessee more competitive with other states."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We added basic education and CTE options for inmates on a path to reentry so they would be better prepared for life on the outside.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This legislature passed each of our proposals last year, and I’m proud to bring to you another set of proposals this year."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"First and foremost, we must be tough on crime."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, we cracked down on fentanyl traffickers, and this year I propose increasing the criminal penalties associated with theft of a firearm and increasing the criminal penalties associated with reckless endangerment of a police officer or first responder."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"But 95% of incarcerated individuals are not serving a life sentence, which means one day they will leave prison and return to a community near you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"It’s in the best interest of your family and community that those individuals be prepared to make that reentry successfully, instead of returning to a life of crime."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"My Criminal Justice Investment Task Force recently issued 23 recommendations on how we can improve in these areas, and I would like to thank the eight legislators and many other Tennesseans who have given their time and energy to developing thoughtful recommendations."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, based on those recommendations, I plan to propose legislation that will improve our probation and parole systems."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"First, we want to expand our recovery courts so that veterans and those struggling with addiction or mental health challenges will have access to specialized supervision."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Second, we want to improve our use of community supervision, including at the end of a prison sentence."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Nearly 40% of those leaving our prisons do so with no oversight, and all too often those individuals are the ones who need it most."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Third, we want to encourage those leaving prison to secure employment by revising the occupational licensing process and encouraging employers to hire the formerly incarcerated."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"By drawing upon evidence-based best practices, we are confident that outcomes for those on community supervision will improve, and our communities will be safer."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We need to be sure that these individuals are prepared to re-enter society and not re-enter prison.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Another way we’re preparing individuals to leave prison is through the recently created Volunteer Mentorship Initiative.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"We launched in the Fall, and already more than two dozen inmates have been matched with legislators and members of my staff to begin thinking about what life looks like at the end of their prison sentence."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Our second round of mentors have just been matched, and they will be doing their orientation in the next few weeks."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Even more exciting, hundreds of Tennesseans have reached out to express interest in becoming mentors, and we will be including them in this process very soon."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And by the way, if you’re interested in serving as a mentor, you can sign up on my website."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I’d like to talk about one other public safety budget item we’re proposing.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For many Tennesseans, the only interaction they have with their government is the Driver Services Division at the Department of Safety."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Tennesseans deserve to have great interactions with our state government, and I have asked our Department of Safety to take steps to improve experiences at our Drivers Service Centers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I am proposing 80 additional positions and funding to assist in decreasing wait times for our customers as they answer the federal mandate to obtain a REAL ID.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Another issue that impacts every person in this state is health care.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Last year, we added $3.5 million to the Health Care Safety Net to help provide direct care to uninsured adults."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"This year, I’m proposing an additional $6.5 million recurring to this program."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,The resulting $17 million in total annual funding would be the highest of any year since the program was created in 2005.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re also setting aside more than $7.5 million to create a Children’s Behavioral Health Safety Net.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,This initiative will work to ensure that no child in need of critical behavioral health services is unable to access them.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Solving our health care challenges requires more than just increased funding - we have to be innovative and thoughtful as well.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"With the encouragement of this legislature, I’m proud that Tennessee was the first state in America to apply for a Medicaid block grant from the federal government."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Tennessee runs the most efficient Medicaid system in the country, and the result is that we are one of only a few states who underspend the federal government’s estimate for what it should cost to cover our population."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Our proposal to the federal government is that we get to share those savings and spend them to cover more services and more people.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"While we do not yet know whether this proposal will be accepted, I am confident that what we’ve proposed would be a good deal for Tennesseans and that no Tennessean would be worse off if it is approved."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Under the proposed budget, my Administration will fund the third year of the Rural Hospital Transformation Program."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And this time next year, we’ll be in a position to consider recommendations from the Health Care Modernization Task Force."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Throughout this past year, Commissioner McWhorter held multiple listening sessions across the state to better understand the concerns and priorities of patients, providers, and payers."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Building on that foundation, they are moving ahead to find innovative working solutions on how our state can better provide access to quality health care that all Tennesseans can afford."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Why is it we would make these investments in education, criminal justice, and health care?"
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Because each of these items help us build what we’re really going after: free and thriving citizens within healthy families and communities.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I'm proud that under our proposal Tennessee would become the first state in America to offer 12 weeks of paid family leave to eligible state employees who experience a significant life event.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I’m proud of our state workers and offering them this benefit will help us continue to retain the best and brightest and help those who help our state.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,This budget also proposes changes to our TennCare program that will benefit young families.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We know infant mortality and maternal health are challenges for our state.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,One in two Tennessee births are covered through our Medicaid program.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,That's why we're proposing two new initiatives to expand prenatal and postpartum coverage for our TennCare recipients.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"First, we are launching a three-year pilot to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months for mothers covered by TennCare."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We’re also expanding preventive dental services to mothers on TennCare.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,My proposal would provide a dental and oral health benefit to pregnant women who do not currently receive dental benefits during the time of pregnancy through 60 days post-delivery.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,This will support improved health outcomes for both mother and child.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"For me, one of the most important things we can do to be pro-family is to protect the rights of the most vulnerable in our state, and there is none more vulnerable than the unborn."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I’ve proposed legislation that would defend and protect the life of an unborn baby from the time their heartbeat can be detected.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I want to share a personal story that has strengthened my resolve in this very important subject.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"A few months ago, my son and his wife had identical twin baby girls, delivered months before they were due, at a time when most babies their size would still be in their mother’s womb."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"When I walked into the neonatal intensive care unit, I stared in wonder at a 1lb 5oz baby girl with tubes and cords and monitors, fighting for her life."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As I watched little Annie, I was reminded once again that every life is precious."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Every life is precious, and we will support pro-life policy in this state because everything precious is worth protecting."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,My first year as governor has been the most enlightening of my life.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"At my age, I thought I’d seen it all, but this job provides a new perspective on our state, its people, and our common challenges."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I’ve been to every county in this state at least three times now.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"I’ve seen a lot - some days my heart swells, glad to see a community thriving or a program working."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Other days my heart breaks, frustrated with the failures of an imperfect system and wishing we could do more."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"But if I could say one thing to my fellow Tennesseans as I enter my second year as governor, it would be this: I see you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To the farmer standing in a flooded field, looking over a ruined crop in West Tennessee - I see you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To the single mom taking night classes at a TCAT, trying to give your family a new opportunity - I see you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To the young girl with great potential and even greater dreams, stuck in a school that doesn’t meet your needs - I see you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,For the police officer putting your life on the line and the crime victim who has been harmed by a broken justice system - I see you.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"To these and the rest of the 6.8 million Tennesseans; you don’t expect government to solve all your problems, but you do expect to get what you pay for - I see you."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,We see you.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And we will keep striving to bring good jobs, good schools, and safe neighborhoods to every corner of this state, because that’s what you elected us to do, and that’s what you deserve."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"As we conclude tonight, let’s be reminded that the walls around us are the walls of history."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Remarkable men and women have accomplished much in this very building.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In fact, one of the most important decisions in the fabric of our nation was resolved 100 years ago right here."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"On August 18, 1920, the Tennessee General Assembly voted to approve the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which enshrined for women the constitutional right to vote."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Even then, 100 years ago, Tennessee was leading the nation, casting the deciding vote in that revolutionary decision."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"In this very chamber, the course of American history was changed."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,I mentioned earlier that much of our success is owed to those who came before us.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Many of those trailblazers are women.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Our state and country have thrived in great part due to the pivotal role played by women in society and in government.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Can you believe that was only 100 years ago?
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,History is funny that way - what seems inevitable now would have seemed far from it to those engaged in the day to day struggle for suffrage.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"One hundred years later, certainly, our struggles are different."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"But as we celebrate the centennial of Tennessee’s role in ratifying the 19th Amendment this year, what I hope we remember is this: the long arc of history remembers fondly when leaders do the right thing, especially when it’s hard, especially when the politics of the day don’t offer any rewards."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"And my hope is that history records that we were leaders who worked together, who stood firm in our individual convictions but who remembered that differences should not divide us."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Rather, they challenge us to take the higher, harder road of understanding, respect, and common purpose."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"God has given us great favor and blessed us with a great responsibility to affect positive change for our families, our communities, and our state."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"May we pursue the challenges before us with grace, humility, and courage."
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Some 6.8 million Tennesseans are counting on us to do just that.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,Let’s make them proud.
Tennessee,Bill Lee,Republican,"Thank you, and God bless the great state of Tennessee."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Thank you Lt. Governor Patrick.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I am honored to work with you and Speaker Bonnen as we embark on this new session.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"A session, by the way, that will etch landmark achievements into this already historic chamber."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I also want to thank the Deans of the two chambers for their leadership —Representative Craddick and Senator Whitmire.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And thanks to the members of the House and Senate, the Judiciary, statewide officials, and our fellow Texans."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"I’m especially proud to have by my side, my wife Cecilia — the fabulous First Lady of the greatest state in America."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"On this very day, about 1,000 new residents will call Texas home. That happens almost every day."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Whether you like that or not, we can never lose sight of the reason so many people make life altering decisions to uproot their families and businesses and chart new paths – paths that guided them to Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They were fed up with big government policies increasingly running their lives and imposing burdensome regulations.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They were taxed out of their states that some of their families had lived in for generations.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,The cost of doing business imposed by heavy-handed special interest groups simply became too oppressive.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They needed an escape. They longed for freedom. They wanted hope.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They found it in Texas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"We may not be perfect, but to all the newcomers I talk to, they think Texas is a governmental Holy Grail."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"The newcomers have joined with long-time Texans, and together we have forged what has become the most powerful state in America."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Texas leads the nation in new job creation. And we have the fastest growing economy in America.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,A by-product of this success is a prosperity that touches all corners of our state. Texas recorded its lowest unemployment rate ever. And wages are rising.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Digging deeper, you'll see that we lead the nation in jobs created by African-American business owners and Hispanic women business owners. And get this – Texas is now number one for Women Entrepreneurs."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Women like Tamala Austin, a Houston entrepreneur who founded J.I.V.E Juice out of her home nearly 7 years ago. She worked tirelessly to grow her business across the Houston area, all while working another job full-time and raising a teenage daughter."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Inspiration, hard work, and drive – they pay off in Texas. They paid off for Tamala."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"J.I.V.E Juice recently became the first African-American-owned juice company to be carried by Whole Foods. I’ve seen for myself – when women succeed, Texas succeeds."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we all know about another number one ranking – Texas is number one in oil and gas production.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"In fact, America will be energy independent by next year."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And as Brooks Landgraf knows, one word makes our energy independence possible – Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And Todd Hunter, with our new LNG export facilities, Texas is helping emerging economies across the globe wean themselves off of coal and instead use clean burning natural gas produced right here in Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And even with increased oil and gas production, we have lowered nitrogen oxide levels by 45%."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,This reduction in pollutants is equal to removing more than 85 million passenger cars off of Texas roads.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"As meaningful as the oil and gas industry is to our economy, the fact is the Texas economy is more diversified today than ever before."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"From aerospace to cybersecurity, financial services to manufacturing, from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and startups."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Texas is the premier economic destination in the United States. And Texas has led the nation in exports for 16 years straight.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And for the past 5 years we’ve led the nation in tech exports.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Now more than ever, the most powerful label is: “Made in Texas.”"
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Importantly, our economic might is not limited to our cities."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,It touches smaller communities across the state.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Job creating projects have broken ground in places ranging from Amarillo to Brownsville, Lufkin and Mt. Pleasant, Temple and Paris, Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"These business expansions are a result of the Texas Enterprise Fund, which promotes economic diversification."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Our collective work has led to record acclaim — and some impressive hardware.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"The Governor’s Cup is given to the state that leads the nation for the most new and expanded business facilities. For the past 4 years, Texas has been ranked number one."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We are joined today by representatives of the Metro 8 Chambers of Commerce.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,These chambers and their peers across the state work with us to keep Texas #1 for business.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They are holding the four Governor's Cups that you helped Texas earn the past four years.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,These trophies are a tangible reminder of the excellence that we achieve when we work together.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Texas remains America’s prime destination for businesses and job-seekers — in part because of actions of Senators and Representatives in this Capitol that helped foster opportunities for Texas’ economic prowess.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,You spurred more investment and business start-ups by slashing regulations and by cutting the business margins tax.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,You funded a road building strategy that provides than more than $7.5 billion for road construction each year.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And you helped make our schools better. More students are graduating from high school and college than ever before.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We have more public high schools ranked in the Top 100 and more Blue Ribbon public schools than any state in America.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Higher education is also better. In the past four years we exceeded our goal of doubling the number of tier one universities.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Today, Texas is home to nine tier one universities. We are on the path to becoming America’s epicenter for research and innovation."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Take just one example. Dr. Jim Allison of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"J. M. Lozano, get this. Last year, Dr. Allison, a native of Alice, Texas won the Nobel Prize in medicine for developing a revolutionary way to treat cancer."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Proving once again that the minds of Texas are changing the world.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Not only is Texas smarter than ever, we’re also safer."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Last session, you acted in bipartisan fashion to protect the most vulnerable children by reforming a broken foster care and child protective system."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And thanks to the leadership of Senator Royce West and Representative Phil King, we are keeping our law enforcement officers safer by providing them rifle-resistant vests."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,You passed laws that crack down on dangerous gangs and human traffickers who threaten our citizens.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"When you combine our legislative achievements with our ground-breaking prosperity, we have elevated Texas to rarefied status."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And I’m proud to tell you the state of Texas has never been better.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"We have accomplished so much. But you know as well as I do, more must be done to fulfill the promise of Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"This session, for just the next few months, we have a unique window of opportunity to tackle some challenges that have plagued Texas for more than a generation."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Our mission begins with our students.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We are graduating more students from high school than ever before.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But we have more students graduating who are not ready for college or a career.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Here's the problem — only about 40% of 3rd graders are reading at grade level by the time they finish the 3rd grade.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Not surprisingly, less than 40% of students who took the SAT or ACT were prepared for college."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To improve this, we must target education funding to help our students achieve in school. That starts with teachers in the classroom."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Other than parents, no one is more vital to our students’ education than teachers."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Texas must recruit and retain the best and brightest teachers to educate our students. This session, we must pay our teachers more."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must provide incentives to put effective teachers in the schools and classrooms where they are needed the most.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we must create a pathway for the best teachers to earn a six-figure salary.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,The teacher pay system used by Dallas ISD shows this strategy works.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"When I visited Blanton Elementary in Dallas, I met an outstanding teacher who was only in his third year and already making more than $90,000."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Teachers across Texas should have that opportunity.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"With Senator Taylor and Representative Huberty leading the reform effort, I know we can get this done."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Working together, we will create a Texas where every student is reading at grade level by the time they finish the third grade."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Where every child, regardless of their zip code, receives a quality education."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And where every student graduates with more than just a diploma.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They will graduate with the tools they need to excel in college or a career.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"That’s precisely what is being done in districts like Dallas, San Antonio, Longview, Pharr-San Juan, and Premont."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"I want to thank the superintendents with us here today, including Superintendents Hinojosa, Martinez, Wilcox, King, and VanMatre, for implementing these transformative strategies."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Rarely has Texas witnessed such bi-partisan, bi-cameral support for an issue this substantial this early in a session."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I credit the leadership of the Speaker and Lt. Governor. I also credit all members of the House and Senate for listening to your constituents.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And I especially appreciate those who worked this past year on the School Finance Reform Commission.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Thank you Senators Bettencourt, Taylor, and West, and Representatives Bernal, Huberty, and Ken King for your leadership."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To keep this momentum going, I am declaring school finance reform and increasing teacher pay emergency items."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"As we improve our schools, it’s not enough to give our students a quality education."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must create a learning environment that is safe.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,No student should be afraid to go to school. No parent should be fearful when dropping their child off at school.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Texas must act now to make our schools safer, so I am making school safety an emergency item."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"After the horrific shooting at Santa Fe High School, I held roundtables with parents, students, educators, law enforcement, and mental health experts."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We developed innovative solutions to better protect our children and teachers.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,It’s time to turn ideas into action.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must do all we can to make our schools safer.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Working together, we will deliver on this promise to our parents, to our students, and to our teachers."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"When it comes to improving school safety, one solution everyone agreed on was the need to address mental health in our schools."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"I commend Senator Nelson, who wasted no time crafting a strategy that does exactly that."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"As she has pointed out, many of our universities already have innovative mental health programs."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Programs like the telemedicine wellness project at Texas Tech.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,It partners with school districts in West Texas to identify and remove students who pose a potential threat. And it provides students the help they need.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,School districts across Texas deserve access to these services.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And as we all know, mental health issues are not confined to our schools. They touch our entire society."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To better address these needs, Senator Nelson provides a broad-based plan."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,A plan that creates the Texas Mental Health Care Consortium to collaborate on statewide mental health needs.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"In typical Texas fashion, her idea is big and bold."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To ensure it has enough time to become law this session, I’m declaring it an emergency item."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Speaking of emergencies, I think we can all agree another emergency is property tax reform."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"If we are going to keep Texas the economic engine of America, we must rein in a property tax system that punishes families and businesses and prevents younger Texans from achieving their dream of homeownership."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We can no longer sit idly by while property owners are reduced to tenants of their own property with taxing authorities playing the role of landlord.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Our constituents are counting on us.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I applaud leaders of the Senate and House for working together in historic fashion on identical bills that limit the ability of taxing authorities to raise your taxes.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"At the same time, the state will be making new investments in education and reducing Robin Hood."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"This isn’t just about restraining the growth of property taxes, it’s about restoring power to the people of Texas."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,That’s why I propose giving taxpayers the ability to fire their property tax appraiser and elect a better one.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"By taking these actions, we'll do more than just reform our property tax system."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We will ensure seniors who have worked their entire lives can afford to retire in a home they’ve already paid off.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"We will give hope to the next generation of Texans, that they too can realize their dream of owning a home."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we will ensure that middle and low-income Texans can remain in the neighborhoods they cherish.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,It is for those Texans that I am making property tax reform an emergency item this session.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,You can't talk about homes in this State without talking about all the homes devastated by Hurricane Harvey.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"When I look back on this past year, I remember the more than 75 trips I took to regions hit by Hurricane Harvey — from Rock Port to Orange County."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Every trip I made, legislators were by my side."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I applaud you for your tireless efforts to serve your constituents.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"As you saw, in the face of the greatest natural disaster, our state has ever seen our fellow Texans show the world that no earthly force is more powerful than Texan spirit."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,From our first responders and emergency workers to community leaders and faith-based groups.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"From our partners at the federal government, to the citizens who gave their time and resources — Texans stepped up to help those in need."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Texans like Morgan McCullough and Casey Aslan. They are nurses at Memorial Hermann Medical Center in Houston.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Morgan and Casey were unable to drive to work because the flooded streets of Houston had turned into rivers.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,So they packed up their gear in an inflatable kayak and they paddled for two hours to get to the hospital so they could care for their patients.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Morgan and Casey embody what it means to be a Texan.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To help communities and residents harmed by Hurricane Harvey, Texas has already committed more than a billion dollars."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Additionally, the federal government has appropriated more than $30 billion in aid."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"But we all know, more resources are needed to help Texans rebuild."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"So I commend the House and Senate, which have both proposed using Rainy Day Funds to help rebuild Texas stronger and more resilient than before disaster struck."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we all agree that we must apply the lessons of Harvey to improve the way Texas responds to natural disasters.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"For example, I support ideas proposed by Senator Perry and Representative Phelan."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They extend disaster solutions beyond just funding and beyond just the coastal region.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And, we must create a system that cuts through all the red tape."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"To give the legislature time this session to make Texas more resilient to future disasters, I am making disaster response an emergency item."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"In addition to rebuilding our communities from disasters, we must also do more to keep them safe from crime."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"We must do more to crack down on the treacherous gangs that bring drugs, weapons, and violence into our communities."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Fortunately, Texas has developed a winning strategy with our six Texas Anti-Gang Centers."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,These TAG Centers are hubs where law enforcement agencies work together to crack down on gang activity and put these criminals behind bars.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We know these centers work.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"For example, in Houston, more than 1,400 gang-related arrests were made in 2017 alone."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Nearly 250 of those arrests involved violent or high threat offenders.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And last year, 57 members of a white supremacist gang in Dallas were charged for drug trafficking and conspiracy to kidnap."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,This was the result of a DPS-led investigation aided by the TAG Center in Dallas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,More communities need these tools.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I’m calling for two new anti-gang centers in Waco and Tyler to rid those regions of dangerous gangs.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Together we will put more gang members behind bars.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We will dismantle their criminal enterprises.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we will make our neighborhoods safer for Texas families.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And I’ll add this, I know we’ve long waited for the day when Texas would not have to provide funding to secure our border."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"And yet, the Federal Government still has not fulfilled its responsibility."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"As a result, I am once again asking that Texas step up and fully fund our border security program."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must also work together to crack down on human trafficking and to protect the victims of this heinous crime.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I ask the legislature to increase funding to create six regional human trafficking squads. These squads will investigate and shut down human trafficking operations across Texas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And absolutely every trafficker should get mandatory jail time.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"These predators should be locked up, not freely roaming our streets looking for victims."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must also do more to ensure justice for survivors of rape and sexual assault.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,One of the most important tools we have is forensic testing of rape kits.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But thousands of these kits have languished untested for years.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,This session we must right this wrong.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Together we must provide more funding to eliminate the backlog and deliver justice that has been denied for too long.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Whether it’s cracking down on human trafficking or eliminating the backlog of rape kits, I know we can get the job done."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"I know because of leaders like Senators Huffman and Hinojosa, and Representatives Thompson and Neave. They are working on legislation to get this fixed."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Let me mention one more thing we must do.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must not turn our backs on the service and sacrifice of the men and women who have worn the uniform of the mightiest military in the history of the world.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Some serve with us today as legislators in this majestic capitol.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We are honored to serve by your side.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But as we know some return broken from battle with injuries both seen and unseen.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Some cannot find a job. Others don’t know how to find a job.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Still others are homeless, possessing only a glimmer of the glory they once fought for."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,They fought for our freedom. Now we must fight for their future.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Texas is home to more than 1.6 million veterans.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,And we've already made tremendous strides to better support our veterans thanks to leaders like Senator Donna Campbell and Representative Dan Flynn.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But this session we have an opportunity to do even more.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,That includes fully funding the mental health program for veterans at HHSC.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We must also fund the Texas Veterans Commission to help veterans receive the VA healthcare benefits they have earned.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,This session we will ensure that veterans get the best services Texas can provide so that the men and women who fought on the front lines go to the front of the line.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"No doubt, what I have outlined today is a transformative agenda."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We have an opportunity to make Texas a far better state.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"I can assure you, people inside and outside the Capitol can see we are on the threshold of something extraordinary."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"But of course, whenever you try to do something extraordinary, it's never easy."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,There will be naysayers. Those who cling to the status quo. It will be hard.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But I believe you were made for this moment. We were made for this moment.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We serve at a unique time in Texas history.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,A time that we can seize to cement a legacy for Texas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We have the power to ensure Texas is a state where our citizens can realize their dream of owning a home or starting a business.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Where we prioritize student achievement and create safer schools.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"A state that puts public safety first, whether it’s in the face of natural disasters or dangerous gangs."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,A Texas where we expand economic opportunity and freedom to every corner of our state and where we provide our veterans with the support they deserve.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I am inspired by the comradery and collaboration that have infused this session.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,I feel it myself.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"For example, I'm willing to step up and work with Lyle Larson to reinstate the rivalry game."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,What we must accomplish will require all of us working together on bold ideas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,But Texas was built on bold ideas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,It was built by the men and women who came before us who worked together to make Texas the most exceptional state in the nation.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"Now it is our time to chart a course that will make Texas even better — not just for the next four years, but for the next forty years."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We have an opportunity to turn bold ideas into reality.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,We have the opportunity to grasp the brass ring that belongs to Texas.
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,"When we do that, we will keep Texas the greatest state in America."
Texas,Gary Abbott,Republican,Thank you. God bless you all. And God bless the great State of Texas.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"President Adams, Speaker Wilson, members of the Legislature, justices of the Supreme Court, Utah’s First Lady, Lieutenant Governor and Mrs. Cox, other constitutional officers, and my fellow Utahns: It is an honor to address you tonight."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"President Adams and Speaker Wilson, congratulations for being elected to your significant leadership roles. I have appreciated working with you to prepare for this session and I look forward to continued collaboration as we address this year’s challenges."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,I extend a special welcome to the 19 new representatives and the 7 new senators here this evening. I thank you for stepping into the political arena to serve the citizens of the great state of Utah.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Our separation of constitutional powers can, from time-to-time, create some tensions. And given current national trends, can I tell you just how grateful I am that the Speaker didn’t disinvite me from delivering this year’s State of the State? Because of your kindness, I promise I won’t cancel your state-sponsored travel to the Six County Summer Meetings in Nephi."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,A few of you might recall some of what I said at last year’s State of the State. My hope at the time was that my eloquent oratory about Utah’s unique spirit of collaboration would capture your hearts and your minds. But no. All that anyone seems to remember about last year’s State of the State is that I gave that speech with two painful kidney stones.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"A lot of people, including my wife, thought I was out of my mind to speak in that condition. But I reminded her of what my doctor had said:  “Gary, this too shall pass.”"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"As it turns out, that was not true. Nothing actually “passed.” So, the other memory folks have of that episode is that I underwent surgery and while suffering under the knife, Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox had a heyday exercising gubernatorial powers with reckless abandon for a grand total of two hours. But the state survived. And, to Spencer’s lament, so did I."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"On a more serious note, as I reflect on the state of our state, this past year came with more than its fair share of challenges. The polarization and dysfunction in Washington DC have had a direct material impact on our state. Drought has created punishing conditions for wildlife and agriculture. Fires have devastated our forests, fouled our watersheds and polluted our air. But Utahns have faced these challenges as they have always done, with faith, courage and resilience. And overall, 2018 was indeed a banner year of accelerated economic growth and prosperity."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"So I am pleased to report to you tonight that in spite of challenges, the state of our state is strong, it is resilient, and our outlook is very bright."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"This past year, however, came at great cost to those who protect our lives and our liberties. Since the last general session, we have lost no fewer than five of “Utah’s finest” in the line of duty:"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"West Valley Code Officer Jill Robinson,"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Draper Fire Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett,"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"National Guard Major and North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor,"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"South Salt Lake Police Officer David Romrell, and"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,Provo Police Officer Joseph Shinners.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Tonight, we are honored to have members of their families with us in the gallery — living witnesses that our security and our freedoms come at great cost. We cannot begin to comprehend your loss. We stand together tonight to honor the ultimate sacrifice you have made as families to serve us and to protect us."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"When I first took office, Utah’s economy was reeling with foreclosures and crippling unemployment. I said at that time that through unprecedented partnerships we could achieve unlimited possibilities. So we set our sights high on becoming the top performing economy in America."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And just look how far we have come! With positive job growth in every sector, Utah is now the healthiest and most diverse economy in the nation today."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Because of the attraction of our strong economy, our biggest challenge now is growth, that if we don’t accommodate, will have a negative impact on our quality of life."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Growth is the groundswell of our prosperity, but it puts pressure on education and how we provide the healthiest, safest, and smartest schools in America; it also makes it difficult for Utah families to find affordable housing; and it increases congestion on our roads.Growth makes it more challenging to protect the open spaces that provide the backdrop for our unique quality of life; it threatens the quality of our air and water and thereby our health."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"I can only address a few of these complex challenges tonight, but they are all worthy of our best deliberations over the next 42 days. And as we welcome some two dozen new faces to the legislature, we look forward to your new ideas and perspectives on these and other issues."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And to our new colleagues, let me share what I believe is some sage advice: Learn everything you can about the state budget. Your solutions to our challenges of growth will be limited if we don’t have sustainable revenue to support good policy. The more you know about the budget, the more effective you will be as a legislator because how we collect revenue and how we spend it is at the core of policy-making."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,And this session we have the enviable task of deciding how to invest over a billion dollar surplus. This surplus is not here by accident. It has come from the hard work of the millions of Utahns whom we serve. It has come because of the decisions of past legislators and governors to spend taxpayer dollars prudently and manage them wisely.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Let’s not assume that this surplus is the new normal. Some of the surplus may be attributed to one-time events, like adjustments made to the new federal tax law. And with this surplus let’s pay down some debt and invest in efforts that will pay future dividends. Let’s prioritize the surplus toward our biggest challenges."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And finally, I agree with Speaker Wilson that we should invest directly in the hardworking Utahns who created this surplus by giving them a $225 million tax cut, which will be the largest tax cut in Utah’s history."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"You know how much I like to talk about Utah’s disciplined fiscal leadership. But our fiscal leadership and budget management face some hurdles. For instance, the much needed Medicaid expansion passed by the voters needs to be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way. And with some common-sense adjustments, I know that we can implement this program without delay."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"A major structural budget challenge is Utah’s narrowing tax base. If we do not modernize Utah’s tax code, I fear that we will not have the capacity to address our growth-related challenges, and that our economy will begin to underperform and that inequities will continue to grow. Developing a more equitable, simple and sustainable tax system will be our number one priority this session."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Let me elaborate. The General Fund that pays for the core governmental functions that benefit everyone — such as public safety, courts, corrections, transportation, social services and Medicaid — is generated from a sales tax that captures a narrowing base of the state’s economic activity."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"For example, we still tax the sale of buggy whips (even though they don’t generate much revenue). Meanwhile, an Uber or Lyft ride is tax exempt. Indeed, Utah has seen the nation’s second largest decline in taxable sales as a portion of consumer spending."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"In 1980, 70 percent of the economy was part of the general fund tax base. Today, it’s only 40 percent, and that number continues to shrink. Here’s an analogy: If the sales tax base of statewide economic activity were represented by a group of 10 friends who meet at a restaurant for dinner, when the bill came in 1980, 7 of the 10 helped picked up the tab. But today, when the bill comes only 4 pay for it and 6 of them walk away without paying a dime."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Common sense tells us that this is patently unfair. And if these trends continue, it is absolutely unsustainable."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,Good tax policy requires broadening the base so that everyone pays their fair share and good tax policy also requires lowering the rate so that everyone pays less.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"But friends, let me warn you that tax reform, although absolutely necessary, is not for the faint of heart. Rather than take the easier road of procrastination and kicking the can down the road, we need to keep our eyes on the big picture and do what is in the best interest long-term for our future economy. To paraphrase President Stuart Adams’ astute observation about the gutsiness of taking on tax reform: “You can’t catch a Hail Mary pass if it isn’t thrown.”"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"As we take on this task, working with leadership, Senator Fillmore and Representatives Spendlove and Quinn, the principles of fairness, simplicity, sustainability and common sense should guide our decisions."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"All the goods and services that make up our modern economy, all the goods and services that benefit from our business-friendly, well-managed state, should contribute to our tax base. That is the definition of broadening the base."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And as we broaden the tax base, we will slash the state sales tax rate. We will cut it by 64 percent from 4.85 percent to a mere 1.75 percent. That is a tax cut of $225 million, especially benefitting lower and middle income families. This would mean that nearly nine out of ten taxpayers will pay less sales tax tomorrow than they pay today."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Now let’s talk for a moment about education, our number one budget priority."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"We have developed an educational road map that is doing for education what we did for economic development: steadily moving us towards becoming the nation’s top education system. We now graduate 87 percent of high school students, which is up 11 percentage points since I came into office. And more students now graduate from high school with college credits. This, coupled with the third lowest college tuition in the nation, contributes to why Utah has the lowest average college student debt."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"I believe, and the people of Utah believe, and I know that you also believe that there is no better investment that we can make than in our Utah students."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"That’s why we set an ambitious five-year goal to invest an additional $1 billion in new ongoing revenue into public education, and $275 million in new ongoing revenue into post-secondary education by the year 2021. Because of your work and a growing economy, we will complete that investment one full year ahead of schedule."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And with these additional funds, we can do some great things. In public education, for instance, we can do more than just cover the growth in new students. We can fund a 4 percent increase in the Weighted Pupil Unit — the main source of funding for public education."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"We can better help students who are at risk of academic failure and keep our schools healthy and safe by investing $30 million into much needed counseling and mental health services. We can also put over $100 million into upgrading facilities, two-thirds of which should go in to school safety improvements."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"In higher education, we can improve accessibility by endowing $50 million of one-time money to a scholarship fund for financially disadvantaged college students. And working with our college presidents and our Board of Regents, we will continue to increase student completion rates and decrease the time needed for graduation."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,As our students graduate they need the knowledge and skills necessary to prosper in a competitive global marketplace.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"So, I would like to see robust computer science courses offered to every middle school student in Utah. I would also like every student to have a better understanding of basic free market economics."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"When I meet with students, I am impressed by their intelligence and curiosity. But frankly, I have been disturbed by some of the rising generation’s fascination with socialism."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"What we see in Venezuela should remind us that tyranny and poverty follow economic systems where the state controls production, where bureaucrats allocate resources and where government picks the winners and the losers."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,That is why I support Representative Jefferson Moss’s bill to strengthen the curriculum in our required financial literacy course to include instruction on the core economic principles that have given us our freedom and our prosperity.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"It is imperative that Utah high school graduates understand not only their civic responsibility and the principles of our nation’s founding and constitution, but also the basic economic principles of free-market capitalism that have made America great."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And, let’s not forget the importance of parental involvement in learning. As we have recognized in statute, parents have the primary role in their children’s education and our policies should always foster that involvement."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"One of the most complex challenges as a result of our growth is our air quality. I appreciate the ongoing efforts to help clear the air by legislators like Patrice Arent, Joel Briscoe, Steve Handy, Eric Hutchings and Todd Weiler."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"We know that a lot of little things, like reducing cold starts, can add up to big improvements. But we can think bigger."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,That is why we have set a goal of reducing by 25 percent our per capita emissions across the state by 2026. And that is why we need to make a down payment of $100 million for data-driven improvements in our air quality.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"The state itself is one of Utah’s largest employers. So let us lead by example. Because tailpipe emissions are such a big part of the problem, let’s reduce the miles driven by state employees by increasing state employee use of transit and accountable telework. Let’s eliminate the dirtiest state vehicles and replace them with Tier 3 and electric automobiles. Let’s improve the energy efficiency of State buildings by using a revolving fund that replenishes itself through efficiencies gained."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"We can also create incentives for the public to pull aging dirty diesel vehicles off the road; to replace more than 5000 wood burning stoves; and to swap out 25,000 pieces of gasoline-powered yard equipment for battery powered options;"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,And let’s make electric vehicle charging stations more accessible and convenient statewide by providing 300 electric vehicle chargers for public use at state facilities and providing incentives for an additional 800 charging stations at private businesses. That would be more than a five-fold increase in the number of chargers available today!
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Our Division of Air Quality estimates that these actions taken together — many of which I hope will also be adopted by other employers — will reduce dangerous pollutants in our atmosphere by a total of 14,000 tons. That’s like taking more than 65,000 automobiles off the road annually, or the equivalent of all the registered automobiles in my home town of Orem."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And speaking of transportation, May 10th of this year marks 150 years since the completion of the nation’s first transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit. It’s hard to overstate the importance of that accomplishment for unifying a nation that had been fragmented by civil war and divided by geography. It made us the crossroads of the west, opening up Utah’s abundant resources to national and international commerce."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"As the railroads came close to completion, Charles Crocker of the Central Pacific Railroad, bet Thomas Durant of the Union Pacific Railroad $10,000 that his workers could lay more track in one day than Durant’s. Durant’s Union Pacific crews had already set the record by laying six miles of track in a single day."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"On April 28, 1869, Durant — sure of his bet — came over to watch Crocker lose the wager."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,Listen to historian Stephen Ambrose’s account of that day:
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"“What the [Central Pacific] crews did that day will be remembered as long as this Republic lasts. White men born in America were there, along with former slaves whose ancestors came from Africa, plus emigrants from all across Europe, and more than three thousand [Chinese]. There were some Mexicans … as well as French Indians and at least a few Native Americans. … They had come together at this desolate place in the middle of Western North America to do what had never been done before.”"
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"The choreography of getting ties, rails and spikes into the right place at the right time so that workers could fasten them securely, mile after mile, was the precursor to the modern assembly line."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"To win the bet, workers had to lay down over 25,000 railroad ties, over 3,500 rails, and drive more than 55,000 spikes. Working from sunup to sundown, Central Pacific workers laid down over ten miles of track in one day — and that’s a record that still stands to this very day."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,What an accomplishment! What an amazing example of teamwork!
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Crocker won the money. But we know that the reason he won was because of the backbreaking labor of the thousands of workers who, day-by-day, mile-by-mile, had perfected their skills and sped up construction."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"The Central Pacific noted the names of eight Irish workers who were there that day. But, unfortunately, no one recorded the names of the thousands of Chinese workers’ whose labor was essential to the success of this herculean effort. Although their individual names have been forgotten, their singular contribution is unforgettable."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"So consider this: the people who literally reunited our nation following the Civil War were the nation’s outcasts — freed slaves, Irish immigrants, exiled Mormons and underpaid Chinese workers, among others."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the Golden Spike, here are some lessons I hope that we take into account as we start another challenging legislative session."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"First, we can and we should do more to protect the nameless, the outcast and the vulnerable."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"Second, even in times of deep division and discord, even when some naysayers are betting against us, great things can be envisioned and can be accomplished."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And finally, although we come from diverse backgrounds and experience, we can work side-by-side, sunup-to-sundown, with the spirit of cooperation to lay a foundation for our future prosperity."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,So let this be the year that we make a major down payment toward continued improvements in air quality.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,Let this be the year we invest to make our schools safer and healthier even as they continue to climb to the summit of educational excellence.
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"And let this be the year that we stand together to create a fairer, a simpler and a more sustainable tax code, by broadening the base, cutting the rates and giving low and middle income families the biggest tax cut in Utah’s history."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"After all, that is the Utah Way."
Utah,Gary Herbert,Republican,"God bless us in this effort, and God bless the Great State of Utah."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Mr. President, Madam Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the General Assembly, distinguished guests and fellow Vermonters:"
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I want to begin by thanking the people of Vermont for the opportunity to serve as Governor, and for their trust and support as we carry out the work ahead. It is the greatest honor of my life."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I also want to thank my wife, Diana, my two daughters, Erica and Rachael, my mom and my entire family for their support and love—I couldn’t do this without you."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,This is the second time I’ve had the privilege of addressing you as we open the biennial session.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Each time, we’ve gone about our work against the backdrop of a national political environment that’s brought out the worst in the public process."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Unfortunately, this still exists today, as too many value political points over policy solutions."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Social media still overflows with negativity and hate, and politics as a whole still seems to divide us more than it brings us together."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I truly believe that in Vermont, we can set a standard that others across the nation can aspire to, and elected officials can look to, as a better way—the right way—to go about the work of the people."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And when the work gets difficult, when tensions build—which they will—when divisions seem too deep to overcome, when we need to be reminded that there’s still good in the world—look no further than the people of Vermont."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We saw the good in the people of Swanton who sheltered and fed their neighbors as flood waters forced them from their homes in the depths of winter.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good lives in the young girls and boys who were inspired when they saw Montpelier native Amanda Pelkey take the ice half-way around the world in South Korea. When she was born, hockey was a game for boys. Twenty-five years later, we welcomed Amanda home, an Olympic gold medalist."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good is in the pride hundreds of us felt, on a cold day in November, to celebrate the return of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, and the incredible work of two Vermont artists, Jerry Williams and Chris Miller, whose craftmanship will stand for generations on top of this beautiful building."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good is in Sara Byers, the owner of Leonardo’s Pizza in Burlington, giving those in recovery the opportunity to get back to work, knowing full well the road may be rough, but believing in the person—and the journey—and seeing past the stigma of addiction."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good is found in the Perry family, whose combined 120 years of dedication and service in the Navy was recognized at a shipyard in Groton, Connecticut as the USS Vermont was christened."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Four sons, three grandsons and a granddaughter-in-law, all following in the footsteps of the former Representative from Richford, Captain Al Perry."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We saw the good in two political opponents running for the House in Lamoille County, Lucy Rogers and Zac Mayo, a Democrat and a Republican debating the issues then sitting together to play a musical duet, proving to the nation there is a better way."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Every day, we see the good in our servicemen and women and our first responders, our teachers and nurses, in our coaches, scout leaders, mentors and all those who serve others without expectation of praise, and often too little recognition."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,The good is in this chamber.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,It’s here because it lives in each and every one of our communities. The places we come from and the people we go home to.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"It’s in our schools and churches, our businesses and farms, our forests, trails and town halls."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good, the courage to show a better path, is the same courage that allowed those who came before us to persevere through harsh winters, to carve our way of life from granite mountains and rocky hillside pastures."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The good is in our hearts, it’s in our minds and it’s who we’ve always been. Today, more than ever, it’s who America needs us to be. And to meet the challenges ahead, to best serve Vermonters, it’s who we have to be."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Our focus must remain on those we’re working for and what we’re working towards.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"To do that, we must face the economic realities that exist across the state, in all 251 towns, cities and villages, and the impact our policies have on each of them."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We must look for common ground instead of highlighting or exploiting our differences, view consensus and compromise not as a weakness, but as a strength."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And if we can, our work, our actions and our results will inspire a renewed faith in government and give hope to every community."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Together, we can work toward a more prosperous future for our state and her people. Where families in every town are moving up the economic ladder with a good-paying job and a way of life they can afford."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Where all kids get a quality education, with the same opportunity, to achieve their full potential. And where we do all we can to provide for our neighbors who need us most, when they need us most."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"An affordable Vermont, with opportunity and economic growth, with great schools in every corner of the state and policies that benefit all Vermonters. This can be our legacy."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We can achieve this vision, but it requires us to recognize and overcome the obstacles in our way."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I know some may be tired of hearing me talk about our demographics—or have given up and believe there’s nothing we can do to change them—while others may not feel a sense of urgency, because their own community hasn’t been impacted as dramatically as others."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"But you don’t have to take my word for it: just ask Moody’s, who recently downgraded our bond rating, in part, due to our lack of population growth, resulting in fewer working-age Vermonters."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,These facts and this problem can no longer be ignored.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Just take our labor force as an example.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Since 2009, our labor force has declined by about 15,000."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"15,000 fewer people working or looking for work."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"15,000 fewer Vermonters available for jobs we know businesses are trying to fill right now."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"15,000 fewer potential income tax payers."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,These losses have been felt across the state but have had the greatest impact outside of Chittenden County.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Since their peak employment, Washington and Franklin Counties have seen a labor force decline of about two percent. By the same measure, Addison and Orange have seen a reduction of nearly five percent, and Grand Isle and Orleans have lost around six. Bennington, Lamoille and Windham have seen their labor force shrink by 10 percent. In Windsor: 12; Caledonia: 13; Rutland: 14. And in Essex, it’s down by almost 20 percent."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,This demographic reality is perhaps most apparent in our schools—it’s like the canary in the mineshaft.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"In our public schools, we’re now educating about 30,000 fewer K-12 students than we were in 1997—that’s an average loss of three students a day for over 20 years. And that trend continues."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"There’s not a single county that hasn’t been affected. Since 2004—which wasn’t all that long ago—Franklin County’s enrollment has shrunk by 3.5 percent—and is doing the best by far. Chittenden, Lamoille and Orange counties have seen declines of 12 percent. Enrollment has dropped by over 16 in Caledonia County, 17 percent in Orleans and nearly 19 in Washington. In Bennington and Grand Isle, it’s declined by 21 percent; in Windham: 23. Three counties—Addison, Rutland and Windsor—have lost a quarter of their students in 14 years. And in Essex, they’re educating 42 percent fewer kids."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,These declines are eroding quality and opportunity for our children. And this is happening on our watch.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"These trends not only mean fewer in our workforce and schools, but fewer customers at businesses, ratepayers for utilities, fewer available for our volunteer fire departments and others who support the needs of our communities."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And fewer to share the costs of state government, with ongoing needs in areas like transportation, building maintenance, public safety and human services."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,But there are other needs as well.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We have a moral obligation to protect our seniors and kids and treat those impacted by mental illness or addiction.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We’re committed to restoring and protecting our lakes and rivers, which will cost Vermonters nearly $1 billion over the next 20 years."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,And we must keep the promises we made to our state employees and teachers to pay their pensions and healthcare costs in full.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,The debt we owe today is over $4 billion and the annual payment to catch up continues to grow by tens of millions each year. But let’s be clear: A deal’s a deal.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Each of these commitments are important, but our stagnant population is threatening every service we deliver, every program we administer and every investment we hope to make."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Even the most optimistic among us must recognize what this means.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Without a different approach or major change in circumstances, our current revenues won’t support our obligations, our wants or even our needs."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"On the campaign trail, a Burlington business owner told me, “We don’t need more taxes—we need more taxpayers.”"
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The solution is really that simple, but the path to a better outcome requires our best ideas, our best work and the courage to make real change."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,That’s what we signed up for and what’s expected of each of us.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Vermonters elected me, and many of you, to ensure we don’t ask them to shoulder any more of the tax burden."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,They’re doing their part. It’s time for us to do ours.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Despite these challenges, we have so much to offer and so much to be hopeful for."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We’re one of the safest, healthiest states in the country. We have a good education system, which I believe we can make the very best, and we have a culture and lifestyle that is second to none."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"These things offer a great quality of life, which is among the best recruitment tools we could ask for."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This is all positive, but we know it’s not enough."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"So, this session, let’s focus on strengthening those assets to keep and attract more working families, with an eye on reversing our population trends."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Let’s grow the economy to support jobs and organic growth, expand our tax base and ease the burden on hard-working Vermonters, because if we want people to both move here and stay, we must make it more affordable."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This is how we rise above the challenges ahead of us, improve the lives of Vermonters and chart a new course for our future."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"First, let’s work to reinforce the things that make Vermont such a great place to live: The health of our citizens and environment and the strength and safety of our communities."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Vermont has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the nation. We rank among the top states for the health of our women and children, the number of mental health providers and physical activity. We’re also among the best in the country with low instances of violent crime, obesity and infant mortality."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Many of you in this room, as well as our predecessors, have contributed to this success."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"But Vermonters still struggle with the high cost of insurance, especially those in our state marketplace."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"That’s why I’ll propose health insurance reforms focused on increasing affordability for Vermonters and, specifically, young people, as we work to retain and attract more of them."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And during the campaign, I talked about a voluntary paid family leave plan, balancing the value of this benefit with Vermonters’ ability to pay. In the coming weeks, I’ll roll out that concept. I truly believe an opt-in approach puts us on a path to the goal that we all share without raising a new tax."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We can also build on our work to protect our environment, communities and kids."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We rank high when it comes to air quality, but we can do more to lower emissions in our state, so I’ll propose using settlement funds to help more Vermonters purchase electric vehicles."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And my budget will propose a long-term funding source for our water quality initiatives, using existing revenues and a new delivery model to put this money to work on the ground."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This fall, we learned from the Department of Health that some students may be exposed to lead in drinking water in our schools. Here’s an area we agree on, so let’s act quickly to protect our kids."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"In order to do that, my budget will invest in lead testing at schools statewide. And, if you’ll work with me in budget adjustment, we’ll have every school tested within a year."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Second, we’ll continue to transform our education system, going from good to the very best in the country, supporting and educating every child from cradle to career."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Many of us here today have heard countless debates about education but far too often it’s been about something other than the kids themselves. From tax payers to teachers, the fate of buildings and debt, old districts and new districts and rates and rebates."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,This has created a fear of change that’s handcuffed us to the status quo and distracted from the single most important purpose of our schools: educating our kids.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We must have the courage to make the conversation about giving every child the best possible chance at a good future. And the truth is: not all of them are getting equal opportunities.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Here is just one example of what students are facing:
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Now, I want to be clear: these are real middle schools in Vermont, but I’m going to call them School A and School B."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Students at each are taught language arts, math, science and social studies."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,But School A has advanced math like Algebra I. School B does not.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,School A has 20 sections of art. School B has one.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,School A offers multiple French classes. School B doesn’t have any foreign languages.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"School A has band, chorus, music, health education, industrial arts and family and consumer sciences. School B doesn’t offer a single one of these."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,You might be surprised to hear that these aren’t schools from opposite ends of the state. These two middle schools feed into the very same high school.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This is not an isolated case: It’s happening across Vermont, so we must continue to address the inequality that exists."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,I’ve heard you and believe me: I recognize that change of this magnitude takes time.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"But in the near term, I believe the best opportunity for progress is in early care and learning—to give all kids, regardless of their background, a strong foundation."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We’ve taken important steps. Let’s build on it this year by working together to give every child an equal chance at success.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Last fall, I identified a new revenue source to put toward these initiatives, which I’ll detail in my budget address."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,If we can work together on a high-quality child care system that’s affordable and accessible—along with a stronger education system—we could set Vermont apart from other states as an education destination for families.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We can, and will, debate on policy—and that’s ok—but let’s focus on the merits of our ideas. Let’s not resort to scare tactics. Let’s roll up our sleeves and make change that gives all our kids an equal shot at success, that puts their interests above special interests, and builds them—hands down—the best cradle-to-career education system in the country."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Next, we must ensure businesses can stay competitive with those in other states around our region. Because we can put all the best ideas on the table to attract young people and support working families, but if we don’t have jobs, none of it will matter."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Act 250 was created nearly 50 years ago to address a rapidly growing state. At that time, there wasn’t the regulatory oversight to deal with the population expansion brought on by the baby boom and the interstate highway system."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,But those circumstances no longer exist.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,That’s why I’ll propose reforms to modernize Act 250 in a way that expands growth in our struggling downtowns while continuing to protect the environment.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We can and must do both.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This proposal builds on work we did together last term to modernize regulation and support the development of affordable housing in our downtowns and growth centers. This year, we can do even more to build stronger communities by updating Act 250 and encourage more compact development while preserving our working lands and rural character."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We also know that broadband is crucial to parts of the state that are currently under-served or, in some cases, not connected at all."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I’m sure most realize this isn’t the cure-all to our economic challenges, but as we seek to attract more people to live and work in Vermont, we must continue to expand access. This session, I’ll put forward a package of reforms, and my budget will include investments, to do just that."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"As I travel the state, I see places struggling to survive, many a shadow of what they used to be. We’ve reached a point where too many are not growing—they’re shrinking."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Whether you’re here from Readsboro or Alburgh, Island Pond, Richford, Springfield, Newport or any one of the proud communities that helped write Vermont’s economic history but now face tough times, know this: I’m eager to work with each of you to develop policies to revitalize all 14 counties and to ensure that hope and opportunity exists not only in Burlington, but in Brattleboro, Bennington, Berkshire, Barton and all 251 towns across our state."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Finally, we need to do a better job leveraging our assets, the things that make Vermont a great place to visit, work and live."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Consider this: In 2017, the top towns for millennial home buyers were not New York City, Boston or San Francisco. They were Williston, North Dakota, Athens, Ohio and Aberdeen, South Dakota."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Millennials appear willing to put affordability and quality of life over the conveniences and attractions of our biggest cities when buying a home.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I believe Vermont can offer what they’re looking for, and in many instances, we already do."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"The work we did last term in the areas of housing, education, downtown development and workforce training, while striving to make Vermont more affordable, were positive steps forward."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,But we must do more.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We know availability of affordable housing is a huge barrier to recruiting young workers—I hear it every day from employees and employers.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Last term, we worked together to create more housing Vermonters can afford. Let’s build on that progress by focusing on existing stock and rental units."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,My budget will propose a package focused on growing the housing supply by revitalizing properties and investing in existing neighborhoods.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"These are steps in the right direction, but it’s not enough to simply offer things that appeal to young people and working families. We must do a better job telling our story and use it to aggressively recruit new Vermonters."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Even if you believe Vermont is perfect, it’s clear we aren’t doing enough to persuade people to move and stay here."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Last year, thanks to innovative thinking from the Legislature, we launched a program offering incentives to remote workers who moved here."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Just passing this law gained international media attention, and as a result, nearly 3,000 people inquired about the program."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This showed us a couple of things. First, publicity works. And second, people do have an interest in moving here but sometimes just need a reason to take that first step."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,That’s why my budget will again propose a labor force expansion package that targets those likely to move and a regional sales team approach to close the deal.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I hope you’ll join me in supporting this effort, because investing to grow our workforce is one of the single most important things we can do for our economy and to reduce the tax burden on those here now."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"This fall, I visited employees at Eden Ciders in West Charleston. My team heard they’ve had success recruiting young workers to relocate here and we wanted to learn more."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"I asked them why they chose Vermont. Most said they liked the sense of community we offer. Many also thought it was a good place to raise a family, while some came for outdoor recreation."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"While there, someone shared that Precision Composites in Lyndonville wasn’t having any trouble filling positions—even engineers."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Now, that got my attention. Because just the week before, I was at Collins Aerospace in Vergennes and they said they were looking to hire 25 engineers but were struggling to do so."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,What was the secret in the Northeast Kingdom? They put a “help wanted” ad in a mountain biking magazine.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,The point is we know people want to come here. We just need to identify and reach those who do.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Collectively, we have a lot of good ideas, so let’s act on them together."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Let’s build the best education system in the country and nurture a business climate that keeps and creates good jobs, so we can better compete with other states."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Let’s think creatively about attracting more workers and families so we have the revenue to better serve the Vermonters already here.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Let’s support policies and make investments that will work towards these goals and do so without digging further into the pockets of Vermonters.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"Because to build the future we want for our kids and their kids, we must ensure Vermont’s affordable."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"While our challenges are great, when we work together, we can do great things."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Over the last two years our record speaks for itself.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"To improve efficiency and better serve Vermonters, we merged the Departments of Liquor and Lottery, a long-standing goal for some legislators in this room."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And we did the same in creating the Agency of Digital Services, which has saved taxpayers about $4 million since its creation."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"With your leadership, we supported foster parents and crime victims, strengthened consumer protections and are working to make prescription drugs more affordable."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We modernized our licensing laws to expand the pool of drug treatment professionals and make it easier for members of the military to enter the civilian workforce.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"When actions in Washington put access to healthcare in jeopardy, Speaker Johnson, Senator Ashe, Republican party leaders from both houses and I stood with Senators Leahy and Sanders and Congressman Welch to protect Medicaid funding. Where else but Vermont would you see such a politically-diverse group joining together to defend access to healthcare?"
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And for two years we didn’t raise a single tax or fee in the General Fund. We also held statewide residential property tax rates level, while fully funding school budgets passed by local voters."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,We removed the tax on social security for low- and middle-income Vermonters and worked to revitalize downtowns and villages throughout the state.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We made the single largest investment in housing the state has ever seen, as well as a 70 percent increase in clean water funding and opened a treatment center in St. Albans that helped eliminate long waitlists statewide, allowing more Vermonters to start on a path to recovery."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"We did all this, and so much more, by working together."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"It wasn’t always easy or comfortable, but hard work—good work—is rarely either of these things."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"And we need more of it because the solutions we seek—in the political environment in which history has placed us—requires that above all else, we focus on what it means to be true public servants."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"When announcing his retirement in 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords said, “In no other job do you have both the freedom and the obligation to solve problems and help people on a daily basis.”"
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,Solve problems and help people.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,A simple concept and an important reminder of why we’re here.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,As partisanship and division have eroded the trust many have in our democracy; as conflict captures headlines far more often than the good work we’ve done to strengthen Vermont; and as reports of our disagreements overshadow all we agree on and the progress we’ve made working together—let’s solve problems and help people.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,That's our job. It’s our responsibility.
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"It’s what our neighbors who elected us expect. It’s what the challenges we’re here to confront demand of us. And most importantly, it’s what Vermonters deserve."
Vermont,Phil Scott,Republican,"As we open this new biennium, with the hope and promise of a new year, let’s commit to this work; put aside our differences to work together, to come together. To solve problems and help people each and every day."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"My fellow Virginians, ladies and gentlemen—good evening."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Speaker Cox, Senator Newman, Justices of the Supreme Court, Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, Attorney General Herring, distinguished members of the Virginia General Assembly—thank you for inviting me to be with you tonight."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Please join me in welcoming my wife, Virginia’s First Lady Pamela Northam. I want to thank Pam for her focus on ensuring that every child in the Commonwealth is able to benefit from access to quality, early childhood education."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Before I begin, I want to acknowledge a moment of history we are sharing together. This is the first time in the 400-year history of the Virginia General Assembly that a woman has led a legislative caucus."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Please join me in congratulating Leader Eileen Filler-Corn on her historic achievement.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And thank you, Delegate Toscano, for your years of service."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Finally, I want to recognize my cabinet and the thousands of Virginia state employees they represent for their committed service to our people. I’m often asked what has most impressed me as governor, and it’s the hard work and talent of our thousands of state workers, from game wardens, to VDOT road crews, to state police."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Each of you works diligently to ensure that every corner of this Commonwealth is a place of opportunity for all.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,It is an honor to serve as the 73rd Governor of this great Commonwealth. It’s hard to believe that a year has already come and gone since I last addressed the General Assembly.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’ve had a very successful year together, and Virginians are better for it."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In fact, we’ve been so successful together that I’ve already started thinking about the future, about 2020. And so tonight, I am proud to announce I am going to seriously explore a run for President … "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,… of the Eastern Shore Antique Car Club.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In all seriousness, I am grateful for all that we have been able to accomplish, working together."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This last year has taught me a great deal, and I know that while it can often be difficult to serve in elected office, the work we do together is as important now as it ever has been.    "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’re a state that supports our veterans, embraces diversity and inclusion, and attracts visitors from around the world. We work every day to make sure that Virginia is a place of opportunity, where everyone can build the life they want to live."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"With unemployment at the lowest levels in decades, a growing economy, expanding access to health coverage to 400,000 working Virginians, and investing record amounts in public schools and environmental protection, we can say with certainty that the State of our beloved Commonwealth is as strong as ever."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I believe Virginians select their leaders for one reason: to make this Commonwealth work better for them and their families, no matter who they are or where they live."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Putting politics aside for the good of the people shouldn’t be hard. But as we are seeing up the road in Washington, some politicians have a way of making even the simplest things look difficult."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In recent weeks, our federal government has shut down, and thousands of Virginia’s federal workers, as well as all of those Americans whom they serve, have paid the price."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Over the course of this 46-day session, Virginia can offer a different path forward."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I believe that most of the time, people find what they’re looking for. If they’re looking for division, they’ll find it."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"But if they—if we—look for areas where we can agree, we’ll find them."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Throughout our history, Virginia has led the nation by example. The Virginia Way charges us to put people ahead of politics, and to leave this place better than we found it."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I am proud to say we’re off to a good start.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In our first year working together, we have achieved major accomplishments that fulfilled our mandate to improve Virginians’ lives."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We passed an historic budget that means 400,000 more Virginians will be able to see a doctor when they are sick."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We strengthened our Commonwealth’s finances by shoring up our reserves and preserving our valuable Triple-A bond rating.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We broke down decades of gridlock on criminal justice reform by finally raising the felony larceny threshold.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We led the region in securing a dedicated source of revenue for Metro for the first time in the system’s history.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We agreed to boost pay for our educators and retool our workforce development efforts.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We worked together to make government more efficient through regulatory reform, and to be a better steward of taxpayers’ dollars."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We created a parental leave plan for state employees, and the House of Delegates and Senate did the same, providing parents an important opportunity to be with their new children."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And in the midst of a growing economy, and the lowest unemployment rate in seventeen years, we have built on our momentum and announced many new jobs and investments in every single corner of our Commonwealth."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"The successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually—but because we worked together. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And while we’ve had a successful year, we can’t rest on that. Every year we must make more progress toward a Commonwealth of opportunity for everyone."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"When we invest in Virginians and their future in a fiscally responsible way, no one can stop us. We can again be the best state in the nation for business."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We can make sure the economy works well for everyone not just those at the top.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We have always been a national leader. Let us never abandon that mantle.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I spent my career as a child neurologist, seeing young patients. Over the span of those years, I saw thousands of children and their parents."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,And I can’t name a single instance when any of them asked me whether I was a Democrat or a Republican—nor did I ask them. They just wanted me to help them.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,And that’s what the people of Virginia want from us.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Last year, I promised that I would govern to get things done. I said that my goal would always be to do what was best for the people of Virginia. I promised I’d work with anyone to make our Commonwealth work better for all Virginians."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I believe there is no better place in this great country of ours to live, work, and raise a family than Virginia."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Let’s renew that commitment to working together to build a Commonwealth where every person, particularly every child, has the same shot at a healthy, safe, and successful life."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I’m here tonight to tell you that the state of the Commonwealth is strong, and we are poised to make it even stronger."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Since I took office, we’ve announced more than 41,000 new jobs, with more than $8 billion in new capital investment."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That means 41,000 more Virginians who can pay rent or mortgages, buy groceries and school supplies, and put paychecks to work in local businesses."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"These new jobs represent people who can live in their hometowns, instead of leaving for a job somewhere else."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Growing up on the Eastern Shore, I know how young people leave our rural areas for jobs and don’t come back."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,That is why our Administration has made it a priority to ensure that every region of Virginia is part of our economic success—so that people can build their lives in the place of their choosing.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We still have work to do, but I’m pleased by the progress we have made so far."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This year, I’ve made nearly 100 visits to rural parts of Virginia to announce more than $1.25 billion in new capital expenditures."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Tonight, I’m proud to make another one of these announcements."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Microsoft will inject significant capital investment to expand its datacenter campus in Mecklenburg County which will create more than 100 new jobs. This will be Microsoft’s sixth expansion at that facility since 2010, which is great news for that area."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This is a huge win for rural Virginia and we should all be proud. I want to thank Senator Frank Ruff, Delegate Tommy Wright, and all the members who played a part in this."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I also want to welcome Jeremy Satterfield, the Virginia manager of TechSpark at Microsoft, who is in the gallery tonight. Microsoft’s TechSpark program works to create more job opportunities in economically stressed areas, and southern Virginia is one of the regions where they’re working."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"With this Microsoft news, Amazon’s decision to select Virginia for a new corporate headquarters, and Micron’s expansion, it’s clear that our efforts to bring new jobs and investments to our Commonwealth are paying off. "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"These companies are attracted to Virginia for our exceptional education system, our skilled workforce, and our strong business climate."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Virginia was once ranked as the number one state in the country in which to do business.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This year, we climbed in the rankings, from fifth to fourth. But we can’t get back to number one if we aren’t supporting our small business owners, the backbone of our economy."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"As a small business owner myself, I’ll never lose sight of that."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This partial government shutdown illustrates why, with some urgency, we need to continue to diversify our economy. No one region in Virginia should be reliant on one industry."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,That’s why I’m so encouraged to see the ingenuity of our small business owners as I travel across the state.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"When businesses large and small want to call Virginia home, that’s a one-two punch for our economy that can’t be beat."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"These businesses all need workers, and preparing Virginia’s workforce for the jobs of the 21st century begins earlier than we think."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We cannot afford to wait until students enter kindergarten to begin preparing them for successful futures.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I want to thank our First Lady Pam Northam for leading a new version of the Children’s Cabinet that is placing an unprecedented focus on early childhood development.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Thanks to their work, last week Virginia was awarded a $10 million federal grant to improve our statewide early education system – and that’s just the beginning."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"With the help of Virginia’s first-ever Chief School Readiness Officer, we are working with leaders across the state and with many of the people here tonight, to ensure that every child has access to quality early childhood programs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Just a few short weeks ago, I shared my proposed budget amendments with the Joint Money Committees."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"These amendments reflect the unique opportunity we have this session: to make forward-looking investments in our success, to further strengthen our reserves, and meet our existing obligations."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We have a world-class education system—but we need to make long-term investments to sustain that quality for our students and to ensure we remain competitive in a 21st century economy.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,That’s why I am eager to work with you to give our teachers the largest single-year pay raise in 15 years.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,This isn’t just about the educators who deserve to be paid more. It’s about improving the education we offer our children by ensuring that we can attract and retain the best and brightest educators to classrooms in every corner of our Commonwealth. 
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Raising teacher pay is only part of the puzzle when it comes to making sure that every Virginia student is able to reach their full potential. Schools, educational leaders, and parents across the Commonwealth have been clear that students need a variety of services to succeed in the classroom."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That’s why I’ve proposed to fund more positions for school counselors statewide, and additional flexible funding so that school divisions can make their own decisions about which services will most benefit their students.  "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Early childhood and K-12 education are the backbone of our efforts to prepare students for successful lives, bringing skills to jobs—but in a modern economy we can’t stop there."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"The good jobs of the future will almost always require some form of training after high school. However, at a time when college costs threaten to price many students out of the market, the good news is that some of the many rewarding jobs in the most exciting fields don’t require a four-year degree."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If Virginia is going to succeed in the economy of the future, we must expand our advantage in higher education and continue to reform our approach to workforce training."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That effort should begin with better aligning our four-year universities, community colleges and skills training programs with the needs of modern day students and the employers who are waiting to hire them."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,And we need to work even harder to make postsecondary education more affordable and accessible to all students.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’re working with the Virginia Community College System to reframe their programming, so that students can get the skills they need on the front end for 21st century jobs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Our training certificate programs and our higher education system need to work hand in hand. And they need to be affordable.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Expensive tuition and high student debt can close the door to opportunity for too many people.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"My budget would offer more tuition assistance, and requires our institutions to create tuition predictability plans."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It is high time we began regulating the companies that service our student loans. While people may not be able to avoid taking on debt to get an education, they should be able to count on basic consumer protections."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I’m also proposing specific tuition assistance for National Guard members so that the men and women who step forward to keep us safe in times of need can advance in their civilian careers as well.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Our National Guard members offer critical help, responding during and after disasters or other missions."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"As we’ve learned from economic development projects, including the Amazon headquarters, good jobs come to states and communities whose workers are ready for high tech jobs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That is why our administration is proud to partner with legislative leaders of both parties in proposing a Tech Talent Investment Fund, which will offer grants to our higher education institutions to help them provide more computer science degrees. Our goal is to produce up to 17,500 more bachelor’s degrees in computer science over the next 20 years. This is an investment in our people and our future."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Tonight, I’m laying out the roadmap to a competitive, brilliant future for all Virginians."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Until we come together to ensure universal broadband access, we are keeping opportunity out of reach for entire communities in Virginia."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"When a community doesn’t have reliable Internet access, it can’t attract businesses, support its home-grown entrepreneurs, keep its students up to date, or use telehealth to keep people healthy."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,The ability to get online anywhere—that’s what makes a Commonwealth of opportunity.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Weeks ago, I shared an ambitious budget proposal to speed up our progress and achieve universal broadband access within the next few years."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This is probably the number one issue I hear from Virginians as I travel around the state, and the number one issue I hear from legislators—both Republicans and Democrats."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Virginia can be a national leader in providing access to its residents if we work together and take advantage of this opportunity.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We’ve talked a lot about jobs and economic opportunity. But we know that a strong workforce has to be a healthy workforce.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Last year we joined together to expand Medicaid coverage to more working Virginians.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We knew people wanted and needed this.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"One of them was Kara Murdock. When Kara was 23, she had to have her arm amputated below the elbow due to a blood clot. This left her unable to do her work as a dog groomer, or continue her studies to become a paramedic."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"She has had numerous surgeries and complications, and has been uninsured since she was dropped from her parents’ insurance when she turned 26."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Kara knew what Medicaid expansion could mean for her. So on Halloween night, Kara camped out so that she could be the first in line to apply for health coverage under the new eligibility rules."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Kara is here with us tonight. Please give her a warm welcome.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Kara, thank you for being here and letting me share your story, so that we can appreciate the impact of our work together on Medicaid expansion last year."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Kara wasn’t the only one who knew what this care would mean. On the first day of enrollment, our call center had a flood of 6,000 calls. "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"To date, more than 200,000 Virginia adults have already enrolled through our expanded Medicaid program. Their coverage began at the start of this new year."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"No longer will these Virginians have to worry about whether they can afford to see a doctor, or get worrisome symptoms checked out. No longer will they fear that one illness will drive them to bankruptcy."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Now if they need it, they can get treatment for mental illness or substance abuse disorder."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"There are thousands of Virginians with stories like Kara’s. This new coverage will help them stay healthy, work, and lead more productive lives."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,It will also serve as a reminder of what we in this room can achieve when we put politics aside and do what we know is right.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Virginians are counting on us to bring that same approach to our work this year. Few issues are more deserving of our intense focus than the opioid crisis.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Last year, we lost 1,227 Virginians to opioid overdose. We lost 1,534 Virginians to overdoses from all drugs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It is my belief that an overdose death is a preventable one, and I want to do everything that I can as governor and as a doctor to bring awareness to this epidemic."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That’s why I traveled to all six of Virginia’s medical schools last year, to teach our future and current doctors about their role in fighting the opioid crisis. As physicians, we need to think more innovatively about the ways we treat acute and chronic pain."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"At each of my stops on this lecture tour, I was accompanied by a young man from Allegheny County who is recovering from addiction. I first met him and his father at a law enforcement event on the Eastern Shore."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"An honor roll student and son of a well-respected sheriff, his journey started after fracturing his leg in a high school football game. He was rushed to the hospital and started on dilaudid for his pain. He was prescribed other narcotics and became addicted."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"When his prescriptions ran out, he turned to heroin, and then fentanyl. To support his addiction and to avoid the symptoms of being dopesick, he took actions that led to run-ins with the law. Eventually he spent 18 months in jail."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"With medically assisted treatment and counseling, the support of his family, and a strong faith in God, he has been clean for over a year."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"He and his father have put their family’s story together in a powerful video. Please welcome Ryan Hall and his father, Sheriff Kevin Hall, to the gallery."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Their story inspired my Grand Rounds lecture, but it also drove an important point home."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This crisis does not discriminate—it can affect anyone from your family members, to your friends, to your neighbors, even yourself. If you need help, or know someone who needs help, please know that we are here for you."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’ve seen a slight drop in overdose deaths due to opioids, but we’ve also seen an increase in deaths from other drugs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"So we must continue the fight with this in mind: our real adversary is addiction, and addiction will always find another drug."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We still have work to do to make sure everyone has access to health care.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That means all health care, including reproductive care. I’m proposing that we put into the Code of Virginia that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health care decisions."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"By working together, we can do so much more to improve access and cost for all Virginians. It doesn’t matter what type of healthcare plan you have—healthcare costs are rising across the nation."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I am committed to working with you to address the root causes of these increasing costs. We can emphasize prevention, and work to evolve toward an outcome-based system, rather than a quantity-based system."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And we can use innovation and data collection and analysis to help us become a world leader in individualized health care, right here in Virginia."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We have already demonstrated that we have the capacity to act together to improve the health and wellbeing of our fellow Virginians—I am confident we can do it again this year.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I’m a parent. Many of us in here are parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. I think we can agree that we all want our children to grow up to be healthy, happy adults. That’s what every parent wants for their child."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Every child in Virginia should have the same chance to lead a safe, healthy, and successful adult life."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And if we agree that every child should have the chance to reach adulthood, then we need to consider what we can do to make our Commonwealth a safer place for our children to grow up."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We want to be sure that all school resource officers are well-trained, so I’m proposing that we ensure all school resource officers go through training approved by our Department of Criminal Justice Services."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Right now, only grant-funded resource officers go through that training."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I want to take a moment to recognize the Student Safety Work Group of the Children’s Cabinet for their hard work to develop recommendations on this important topic.  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of leaders in both chambers, and in both parties, to address the many challenges our children face in their schools."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If we want every Virginian to have a chance at a healthy, safe, successful life then we need to have a conversation about responsible gun ownership."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I recognize that this is a topic where it has been difficult to have meaningful dialogue.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Dialogue, by its definition, is an exchange of ideas and opinions in order to resolve a problem. I hope we can all agree that we have a problem."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In 2017, 1,028 Virginians died of gun-related causes."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In comparison, that’s more deaths due to gun violence than the 956 Virginians who died due to vehicle accidents in 2017."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We have recognized that we have a problem with road safety and vehicle deaths—and we have acted together to prevent future ones.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"My administration has launched the Executive Leadership Team on Highway Safety, and I know there is legislation this session, including efforts to strengthen our Move Over law, aimed at protecting our first responders."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If we are able to agree that we need to act when we have a problem with highway safety and preventable deaths, then surely we can agree to work together to keep more Virginians alive by improving gun safety."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"As I said earlier, this has to be a dialogue—that’s a two-way exchange of ideas."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,This year I’m proposing we act to approve an “extreme risk law.”
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It creates a legal way for law enforcement and the courts to temporarily remove firearms from someone who has shown dangerous behavior, and who poses a risk to themselves or others."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,This idea has passed Republican legislatures in other states and been signed by Republican governors.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It shouldn’t be a partisan issue to make sure that weapons are not in the hands of people who pose a threat, especially when the threat is to their own safety or their family’s safety."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"As we work to make our roads safer by focusing on driver behavior, we also need to be sure our roads themselves are as safe as possible."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Along I-81, from Winchester to Bristol, it’s becoming more difficult for traffic to flow steadily and safely."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"While 81 is a major corridor for interstate travel, it’s also a heavily used local road."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Stretches of I-81 have become safety hazards, and accidents and delays also impact local commerce."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Businesses, residents, and officials along the corridor agree that I-81 needs significant improvements."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,So I’m proposing to establish the I-81 Corridor Improvement Program.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,This legislation will provide a dedicated funding source for I-81.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We all know that current resources are not adequate to the task of making I-81 a better, safer road. I’m happy to say that we’re working across the aisle, with legislators from both parties whose districts include I-81, to make this happen."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If we want to ensure that every Virginian has the same shot at economic opportunity, we need to position ourselves to respond to the growing reality of climate change."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"These changes are having an impact on our communities and our economies, whether you are facing coastal flooding in Hampton Roads or storm effects in the Southside and the Southwest.  "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I have shared my budget proposals to make historic investments in the protection of our environment and our water quality. These proposals will lead to cleaner water and air for all Virginians, and they will also position us to create the next generation of energy jobs in solar, wind and other emerging technologies. Time is of the essence—the time to address these challenges is now."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Our farmers are working to do their part to support agricultural best practices and reduce runoff from their farms into the creeks nearby.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"With us tonight in the gallery is Kendall Tyree, executive director of the Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts and vice-chair of Virginia Forever."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Kendall, we thank you and the groups you work with for all the work you do on agricultural best management practices and natural resources issues."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We’re glad to support them in those efforts by doing our part to support pollution reduction efforts across the board. That’s why I proposed increased funding for programs to help reduce runoff and for our Stormwater Local Assistance Fund.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And this should be the session where we come together and require clean closure of coal ash ponds throughout our Bay watershed. These ponds are in Republican and Democratic districts, and Virginians don’t view them through political lenses—they want them closed cleanly and their waterways protected."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,The environmental damage that Hurricane Florence caused in North Carolina showed us what will happen to these ponds if we don’t act now.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Tonight we have some good news from our criminal justice system to announce—for the third year in a row, our prison recidivism rate is the lowest in the country."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This is due to our re-entry programs and treatment offered by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Tonight our director of the Department of Corrections, Harold Clarke, is with us in the gallery."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I want to thank Harold for his department’s work to make sure that we do as much as possible to prepare people to leave our corrections system and rebuild their lives.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We want to keep people safe. But we shouldn’t use valuable law enforcement time, or costly prison space, on laws that don’t enhance public safety."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,So I’m proposing that we decriminalize simple possession of marijuana.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Current law imposes a maximum 30 days in jail for a first offense of marijuana possession.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Making simple possession a civil penalty will ease overcrowding in our jails and prisons, and free up our law enforcement and court resources for offenses that are a true threat to public safety."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Moving forward on this front will have the same significance as our work together to increase the felony larceny threshold: one mistake won’t define Virginians for the rest of their lives.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We can continue our progress on criminal justice reform by ending the practice of suspending driver’s licenses over failure to pay court costs and fees, and by ending the suspension of licenses for non-driving offenses."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"When we take away people’s driver’s licenses, we make it harder for them to get to work, and thus make it even more difficult for them to pay their court costs."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We shouldn’t be punishing people for being poor.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,These simple reforms to our criminal justice system will make our Commonwealth a more fair and just place without threatening the safety of our communities. Let’s work together to pass them this session.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We have a chance this session to provide targeted tax relief to Virginians who aren’t seeing much help from the federal tax changes.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Our tax code should work for everyone—not just the highest earners. That’s only fair. But Washington is actually making these disparities worse. 
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"In Virginia, we can work together to restore balance and fairness on the state level. "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I’ve put a proposal on the table to respond to the federal tax changes by making our existing Earned Income Tax Credit refundable.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This credit already exists in our law, and it benefits middle-class workers—our teachers and law enforcement officers, our veterans, the folks working at restaurants and department stores and small businesses. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported this credit, because it works."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"Over the course of the last year, we have had conversations about incentivizing Virginians to get back into the workforce—my proposal does exactly that, because you only get this credit if you work and pay taxes. "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This is a chance for us to have a dialogue about making sure the system is fair for every Virginian. When corporate stockholders benefit but a teacher does not, that isn’t what I call a fair system."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"That’s why I made this proposal—because I want our response to these tax changes to be fair to Virginians in every district, every community."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It’s clear that we need to conform our tax code to the federal code, because Virginians deserve a simplified process. After that, I’m open to a discussion about how we respond to these tax changes in a fair way. I’ve put my ideas on the table. My priorities remain ensuring that our tax changes are fair, that we put money into reserves and pay our bills, and that we invest in our priorities. I know others have ideas, and I look forward to having a dialogue about our priorities."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We must make sure that one good job is enough for a person to live on, and that hard-working Virginians in every locality and region benefit from our tax proposals."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"This year, we will mark a significant anniversary of Virginia’s long history of representative democracy. This tradition stretches back 400 years, well before the birth of this nation. "
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Let’s take a moment to reflect on that long and complex history. The story of Virginia is rooted in the simultaneous pursuit of both liberty and enslavement.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"As we approach the anniversary of the first representative General Assembly in the New World, we have a responsibility to confront this truth."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"It obligates us to the full and true exercise of democracy. In this day and age, that means ensuring the elimination of unnecessary and prohibitive barriers to voting."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I’m proposing we finally allow no-excuse absentee voting.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If we are going to work together to ensure that every Virginian has equal opportunity for a successful life, that means enshrining equal rights for women and legal protections against discrimination in our laws. This is not a partisan issue, and legislators from both parties have long championed this idea. Virginia can be the 38th and final state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment this year—it’s time we do so."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"A few weeks ago, I came before your money committees to talk about budget proposals."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I said then, and I’ll say to you all tonight, Virginia is in a good place."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Our economy is strong. Our unemployment is low.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’re in a position to put money in savings, invest in priorities, and provide targeted tax relief to the middle-class Virginians who need it most."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I’m not going to pretend that there won’t be 140 campaigns to run after we adjourn here. But this isn’t Washington—we come to Richmond to do the people’s work, the way they expect us to do it."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,And there’s a lot we can accomplish together.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I know that not everyone will agree with the ideas I’ve outlined tonight.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,But I don’t believe the people of Virginia elected me to sit on the sidelines. They didn’t elect any of us for that.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"But they did elect us to work together, to do the best we can for them."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,And they elected us to be thoughtful about our work here. They want us to give true consideration to a variety of ideas. That’s the Virginia Way.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"I hope that as we go through the next 46 days together, we give consideration to each other, and to our ideas. It can be tempting to retreat to our corners and shout at each other. But I believe we all have that internal moral compass, the one that guides us toward the right thing to do. I hope we all follow it this session."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We can come together, to ensure that we keep our economy strong in every corner of Virginia."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We can come together, to make sure that our children have the best chance possible to grow into healthy adults."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We can come together, to make sensible criminal justice reforms that will keep people who shouldn’t be in jail, out of jail."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We can come together, to ensure that Virginia, the home of the oldest representative body in the new world, is also the home of voting laws that put the voters’ needs first."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"And we can come together to make sure that we’re building a Commonwealth of opportunity, where everyone has the tools they need to build good lives."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,We can do all of this and a lot more.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I believe strongly that we often find what we’re looking for.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"If we come here looking for gridlock and partisan battles, we will likely find those."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"But if we look for what unites us, what gives us the best opportunity to get things done, we will find that."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"We’re not going to agree on everything, but if we look for what we have in common, we’ll do better work for the people of Virginia."
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,I look forward to working with all of you to find our common ground.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,Thank you for your willingness to serve our great Commonwealth.
Virginia,Ralph Northam,Democrat,"May God bless all of you, and may God bless Virginia."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Thank you, Rabbi Dunsker, for your inspiring words."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Thank you, Sergeant Scheer, for the beautiful rendition of the national anthem and for your service in the Army National Guard."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,I extend a warm welcome to former Governor Gary Locke here today and thank him for his service as well.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,I welcome the new legislators in your ranks who have stepped up to serve the people of this state. I congratulate your families who will be part of your adventure.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And I thank my wife, Trudi, and my entire family for joining me on my adventure."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"I’m pleased to note a couple historic firsts in this Legislature. The people of Washington elected the first Native American woman to the House, Representative Debra Lekanoff."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And they elected the first refugee, Representative My-Linh Thai, to the Legislature. These are firsts we all are proud of."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Madam Chief Justice, distinguished justices of the court, members of the Legislature, tribal leaders, state and local government officials, members of the Consular Corps, and most importantly, my fellow Washingtonians."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Today, we gather in a place that tells much of our Washington story."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Today, we come together from across the state — from the rolling hills of the Palouse to the coastal rocks of La Push — to find inspiration for the work we do."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And today, as we reflect on our 2018 successes, we look ahead to 2019 and offer a rallying cry to build this new and enduring chapter that is the profound story of Washington state."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Our story already reflects optimism and strength. But as Washington’s leaders, we carry an obligation to never be satisfied with how far we’ve come."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"That was embodied in what Bruce Lee, the Washington actor, philosopher and martial artist said: “There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”"
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,He was right. Our state history offers example after example of leaders willing to do more and to be more — even after they toppled barriers and shattered expectations.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Did Bill Gates and Paul Allen stop after forever changing the world of personal computing? No. They kept asking “what if?” and not only built on the landscape of the technological world, but delved deep into science, medical research and culture and redefined what giving back means."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Did Steve Gleason, one of the best Cougars out there, stop after he blocked that punt during the 2006 New Orleans Saints game? No. Congress just awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal for his advocacy for people with Lou Gehrig’s disease, something he works through every single day."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Did Tarra Simmons of Bremerton quit after she redirected her life while serving time in prison? No. She earned a prestigious fellowship, graduated from Seattle University School of Law, and when told she couldn’t fulfill her ultimate dream of being a lawyer, she appealed to the state’s highest court so she could take the bar exam. Today, she practices law and helps others find a second chance after incarceration."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re glad she can join us today.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We are drawn to stories about people who don’t quit. They call to us because they remind us we have the same promise for greatness.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"In 2019, we are again poised to be more and do more. Yes, we’ve accomplished much already. But all of it — everything we’ve done — brings us to a tipping point."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,So today offers us two choices:
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"- One, do we reflect on the success of our current story and decide we’ve done enough?"
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"- Or two, do we rise up to write one of the worthiest chapters of our time that tells future generations who we are?"
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Though we’ve accomplished much, we still face challenges that require us to push further."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,At the top of that list is the imminent threat of climate change.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"In just the past few years, our state experienced record-high temperatures, record-low snowpack in some locations, higher ocean temperatures and high acidity in our waters."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Historic wildfires blackened our air so much that we had the worst air quality in the world. Not China, not India. Washington state. The smoke shut down outdoor pools in Wenatchee, and impacted all of us, forcing kids and older adults to stay inside to protect their health."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Scientists say if we don’t act now, this will become the norm — a permanent degradation of what we love, our magnificent state."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"I don’t know of any other issue that touches the heart of things so many of us care about: our jobs, our health, our safety and our children’s future."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,But this doesn't have to be our future. Science affirms the necessity of action — this day.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"This is the 11thhour, but it is Washington’s hour to shine. It’s a time of great peril, but also of great promise."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Clean energy and low-carbon technologies are increasingly competitive in the marketplace. Innovation brings us cleaner, cheaper, better fossil-fuel alternatives every day."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,This innovation benefits our rural economies as much as our urban and suburban economies.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Just last year, I helped cut the ribbon for our state’s largest solar array in the small town of Lind. I was joined by Senator Schoesler and Representatives Dye and Schmick to celebrate the good-paying jobs the project brings to their community."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,These kinds of jobs have propelled our clean energy sector to grow more than twice as fast as the rest of our economy. There is no greater job opportunity than the opportunity of clean energy. It’s why a historic alliance of labor and communities of color has joined with conservation and environmental groups to push for climate action.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Looking at the many new faces in this chamber today, I am more optimistic than ever about the clean energy future we’ll build together."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We will pass legislation to transition to 100 percent clean electricity, transform our buildings with cost-saving efficiencies, and modernize and electrify our transportation system. We’ll phase down super-pollutants and phase in cleaner fuels."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"This means by 2035, nearly all our electricity will come from solar, wind and hydroelectricity, instead of polluting fossil fuels."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,It means you’ll save money on lighting and heating costs because our homes and businesses will be much more energy efficient.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,It means our transportation system will be the cleanest in the United States because we’ll power it with clean electricity and clean fuels.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Combined, these policies will steeply cut emissions — the equivalent of taking about 3 million cars off our roads."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"This transformation has started but we need to do more, do it bigger and do it faster."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"So when your grandchildren ask what you did to protect them from climate change, you can tell them you weren’t sitting around saying it was someone else’s problem. You took action. Because that is who we are in the state of Washington."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,It’s going to feel really good to be part of the solution. It’s going to feel really good to make history.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,Another historic chapter we need to write about is mental health.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"While we’ve taken significant steps to improve our physical health in medical schools like the Elson Floyd College of Medicine at WSU, we can improve our mental health care efforts, too."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We need to transform behavioral health from a system that responds to crisis to one that helps people before they reach crisis.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"For those with a loved one who has waited too long for the right kind of treatment, we know this challenge is urgent."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,Our families and friends are suffering and we can do so much better.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We must find room for hundreds of people at new community-based facilities so patients receive services in places close to their families, homes, places of worship and communities. We must also expand our professional workforce so patients are treated."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,That’s why I’m proud to pursue a new partnership with the University of Washington to create a teaching hospital to serve these patients and to train behavioral health providers using a unique new curriculum.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We can turn this story around and direct it toward hope.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And I’m pleased that we’re at the beginning of a bipartisan effort to do just that. We will create a story this year about a holistic model for behavioral health that encompasses the family, the community and the promise of timely care."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,The third thing we need to focus on is saving the Southern Resident orcas.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Despite our orca task force already in place, the event that truly told the story of the orcas’ fate happened last summer."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Many of us watched as Tahlequah, a mother orca, carried her dead calf for at least 17 days. We saw a mother’s grief. We felt it. Our hearts broke as we shared in her loss."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,This cannot be their fate.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We must make unprecedented investments to save our orcas.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"The demise of any species is a warning in our natural systems. We have to restore the balance of our ecosystem to sustain orcas, salmon and the quality of life for all Washingtonians. For as the orca go, so go we."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’ve received thousands of calls from people around the world pleading for us to do more. Our orca task force, led by Dr. Les Purce and Stephanie Solien, has spent hundreds of hours researching the science behind survival. We thank you and the members of the task force."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"The actions we have to take, such as increasing salmon stocks, fixing culverts and decreasing vessel traffic risks, are hard but necessary."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We have just one last chance to save these orcas. In this perilous moment, we must answer back with action."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,The fourth issue — one still at the forefront — is education. I thank everyone in this chamber who has been part of the years-long effort to fully fund basic education. This was an enormously heavy lift that I’m proud we accomplished together last year. This was a remarkable bipartisan effort; both parties shared in that success.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"But we have always said we couldn’t stop at basic education. For anyone who cares about equity in education, early learning is the best way to secure a strong start for every child, regardless of their family’s economic circumstances."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re investing in children well before they enter the elementary school classroom for the first time. In the past six years we’ve nearly doubled the number of children in early learning programs to more than 15,000."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,My budget builds on that to expand preschool with a new ‘birth to 3’ preschool program. And it would create a statewide referral system to connect families with early learning services and facilities.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,My budget would also offer universal home visits. This gives every new parent the opportunity to get a visit from a nurse during the first few weeks back home with their newborn to share important information and build confidence.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And once those children reach the other end of their education and prepare to graduate from high school, we want to open up as many pathways as possible, including apprenticeships, certificates and degrees. For high-school students or individuals who seek an experience outside a four-year program, our Career Connect Washington initiative gives them that option."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,It links students to real-world experience in careers that interest them. And we know that experience is invaluable. It gives them a better shot when they apply for that first job.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"My budget will provide 100,000 students over the next 10 years an option to dive into their interests through apprenticeships and paid internships, and fall in love with a career before they graduate. This means more Washington students can take advantage of great careers here at home in one of the best economies anywhere. Don’t our kids deserve that?"
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re also supporting future students who want more education but can’t afford it. The Washington College Promise is our new statewide free college program that guarantees state financial aid to eligible students. We did this because a student’s financial challenges should not stand in the way of the pursuit of their dreams.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"As we grapple with these challenges in our state, we must also confront other forces seeking to undermine our progress."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"During the past two years, we’ve been challenged by federal actions that appeal more to our darker natures than our better angels."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,But we know that’s not who we are. We are going to write an even brighter chapter of our Washington story.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re the state that invests in our people. That’s why we’re the only state that ranks as the best place to work and the best place to do business. What an incredible achievement.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the state significantly ramping up efforts to help struggling Washingtonians find stable, affordable housing. I propose using more than $400 million for chronically homeless individuals, homeless youth and unsheltered families with children."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re the state offering to pardon thousands of people with misdemeanor marijuana convictions.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the state that’s going to tear down the systemic barriers to work and education faced by people of color, people with disabilities, veterans and women. Initiative 1000 is a well-reasoned approach to do just that."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the first state to pass a bill requiring net neutrality, which will guarantee free and open internet. And we’re the state pushing for broadband for Washingtonians who want to start a business or further their education — no matter where they live in the state."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re the state that believes women and survivors deserve to be heard. We will make sure our policies set the expectation that every employee feels safe and welcome in the workplace.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the state that supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. I promise you, we will always provide reproductive health services to women in our state."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"While too many in D.C. remain in the grips of the NRA, we’re the state that stands up for common-sense gun-safety reforms. We’ve closed background check loopholes, banned bump stocks and approved protective orders that keep guns away from people in crisis."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And at that same time, we’re making sure students don’t worry more about bullying or gun violence than they do about their algebra homework. We’ve heard over and over what an impact a caring adult makes in a child’s life when the child is working through issues like depression, bullying or peer rejection. That’s why we’re committed to putting more social workers, counselors, psychologists and nurses in our schools."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the state that put a stop to the death penalty, and I hope this Legislature acts to definitively end this practice once and for all."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re the state that updated deadly force laws and require training to help law enforcement officers de-escalate violence. Communities and much of law enforcement came together on this and produced a model for the country on how to have what can be a very difficult conversation. I tip my hat to the people involved who helped form these changes.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"While there has been an unprecedented assault on working families, we’re the state that protects workers’ rights. We built the best-in-the-nation paid family and medical leave program, we’re supporting long-term care planning and we will fight for a public health option to ensure health care for all."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"While other places close their borders and fear the unfamiliar, we’re the state that opens our communities to refugees seeking safety, shelter and sanctuary."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"While the president stokes fear of ‘the other’ at every opportunity, we’re the state that embraces our differences and diversity. I’m proud of the incredible diversity of the people we’re appointing to judicial benches, boards, commissions and cabinet agencies. We’re the state making sure our government looks like the people it serves."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re the state that passed the Voting Rights Act. And while other states threw up barriers to suppress voting, we’re the state that passed a nation-leading Access to Democracy package to make sure more people cast their ballots, not fewer."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,All this builds toward our promise for greatness.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We’re constantly refreshed with new ideas, new cultures, new communities and new technologies. We seek out new talent from the world’s many pockets because that makes Washington stronger."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"We affirm that diversity is a strength, not a weakness."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,It’s the collective stories of all — the story of the refugee from Vietnam and the story of the third-generation Chelan orchardist — that ground us in longstanding Washington values.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,Now I know the things we’re proposing this year are not small or easy.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,But good things in our story haven’t happened through timidity. They happened because of our optimism and bold action.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,Good things in our story happened because we didn’t give up.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"Again, I ask you: Which Washington story will prevail? A story where we rested on our laurels? Or the story where we rose up, called out and wrote a golden chapter that’s worthy of our best selves?"
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,... This chapter will show we answered our obligation to lead with higher expectations;
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,... This chapter will show that we made Washington better for everyone seeking a fair shot;
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,... This chapter will show that we defended the values we stand for;
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"... And more than anything, this chapter will show the heart of who we are."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,We’re the people who always make history. I really believe in the state of Washington.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And I believe our next Washington chapter must show that we pushed the limit and moved beyond our plateau, that we always looked for the next beginning."
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,So let this be our profound story. Let it be bold.
Washington,Jay Inslee,Democrat,"And most of all, let it make history."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Unless y'all are all wanting to be here all night, you got to quit this clapping so much. That's all there is to it. Thank you so, so much. Speaker Armstead, President Carmichael, members of the Board of Public Works, Justices of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Senate Minority Leader Prezioso. How about that? And I got that the first time. Roman said I did pretty good with that. House Minority Leader Miley, and all our great legislators. "
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Tonight is a really important night, you know, I want before we get into the meat and potatoes of what I have to say, I want to recognize a couple of people. These four people came with our great Speaker Armstead. These four people are principals that suffered through a 1,000-year flood. You know, I firsthand know what the flood was all about, and it was beyond belief terrible."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I don't know where they are, but if they can stand: Mike Kelly, the Principal of Herbert Hoover; Missy Lovejoy, the Principal of Elkview Middle; Cindy Cummings, the Principal of Bridge Elementary; and Vanessa Brown, the principal of Clendenin Elementary. Your courage goes way, way, way beyond being unnoticed. You know, it took wisdom and strength and courage to some way, somehow, battle back. We got a long ways to go. But that's what we do."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"There's another group here it's called KVC Health Systems. And there is a CEO that's a national CEO. His name is Jason Hooper. And let me tell you what they're doing. They're going to bring a college basically for foster kids to Montgomery. A place that really needs us, needs our jobs, needs hope. The great Gordon Gee of WVU have been terribly instrumental in this. Wherever you are, Jason and your team, please stand as well."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, stay with me. Isn't this place reverent. Hallowed ground. Tonight I'm going to do the best in my ability to deliver a speech that I think is phenomenally important. There is no question there's been speech after speech delivered here. I am telling you, I can't possibly imagine that there is a time as dire and a time as important as tonight."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you. There is no question we've been fiftieth forevermore. We're better than that. Now, like it or not like it, we're dying fiftieth. This is the most difficult and the biggest depression that we could ever possibly imagine. The biggest of the biggest."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you this. On a little bit of light humor. But there is a fellow, his name is Ricky Mokel. He's a comedian. He said as a child he was hyper, and his dad gave him a shovel. And he used to love to dig. And he would dig and dig and dig and dig and dig and dig to the point in time where he couldn't get out of the hole. And then he said, ""What's the use? There's no point in digging anymore, is there?"" Well, he says it to be funny. Because then he turned, and he said he and his dad had a password at that point in time. And when he would get to where there was no way he could get out of the that hole, he would go: Help! Help! And his dad would come and get him. Well, trust me. We got to quit digging."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We are such in the hole that we got to quit digging. We got to quit working against one another. We've got to some way hold hands with each other and run across the finish line together. We've got to have new ideas, and I'll get to those in just a few minutes."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"The other thing is just this. You've honored me beyond belief. You elected me as your Governor, a person that had never been a politician, in the wake of me running as a Democrat, at a time when Donald Trump won our state by 17,000 million percent."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, there had to be a reason. And the reason is just this simple. And if I make some people mad, I just make them mad. But the people knew that it didn't matter to me. It didn't matter to me if you were a Democrat or Republican, an independent, all that mattered to me was one thing. And that was that you are West Virginians. And I'm a West Virginia. And I just want goodness for our state. I've said it over and over and over."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, there will be somebody that will be on some witch hunt to try to beat on me about something. But I want again to announce to the world in every way. I, nor my family, want anything from this other than goodness for you and our state."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you. You've trusted me with your vote. I absolutely need you now to trust me with your voice. Now, you don't see any teleprompters here. You know, a lot of news media said, you know, he's folksy. I didn't know that I knew how to spell that. But there are sure no teleprompters. But you see, my definition of that would be plain talk. And that's what I think West Virginians want to hear."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, the truth is, it's time for gigantic decisions. The past four years, no matter how hard we've tried, we've lived off Rainy Day. And we've lived off the low-hanging fruit that we could cut away. We have. We've cut probably $600 million of waste. And we've cut the Rainy Day Fund into half."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, this year, right now, you're going to have to cut the Rainy Day Fund 123 million more dollars. No way around it. Right now. What are you going to have? 500 million. What are you going to do? What you going to do? You're faced with a $500 million hole in the bucket. And the next year is a $700 million hole in the bucket. If you cut Rainy Day more, the rate holders, the people that create our rates for our bonds are going to torpedo us."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We've got issues. We've got real problems. So I want to tell you this. I don't mean this in any bad way, because I'm the one that signed up to run for Governor. But we've got an 18 carat dog's mess, don't we? We do. I didn't create the dog's mess. I have inherited the dog's mess. And I am telling you, you have to have real direction and real ideas and real cooperation together to be able to get out of this."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, there is two ways. Two ways you can get there. And you got to forgive me, I'm not nervous, but I just sweat a lot. A lot. And I got a bad knee, and man does it hurt. But there's two ways you can get out of it -- or a combination of ways. The first way is to just cut more. Cut more. Well, let me tell you just this. Just think about this just for a second. Are you willing -- are you willing to eliminate all of our state parks? Are you willing to eliminate all of your colleges and universities other than Marshall and WVU? Shut them down? Are you really willing to close our tracks, to not have dogs, and to not have horses? Are you really truly willing to gut your seniors? Are you willing to turn our backs on our vets?"
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I can't get there. I can't get you there. Because you know why? Because at the end of what I've just said, you're halfway home. What then are you going to do? What is West Virginia going to become? A nuclear waste site? Is it going to become the place where our nation sends all of its prisoners all of the time. Are we not better than that?"
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me give you just this scenario. Here's an analogy. You got a factory. We're the factory. You've got a factory. The factory has got a $100 million in the bank. The factory is $200 million upset down. Think about it. How we going to fix it?"
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,Here is what we can do. Take the hundred million away from the factory just like that. We got a hundred million dollars upside-down. Then I tell you what's let's do next. Let's cut 25 percent of the people off. And then I tell you what else let's do. Let's cut the wages of everybody else there by 20 percent. And you're still not there.
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"So I tell you what let's do, let's sell 75 percent of the equipment out of the factory. And then, we in here will go home and say, ""We did it. We balanced the budget."" And you know what will happen? The sun will come up tomorrow, and we'll say: Holy horse, whatever, the factory is dead. The factory is gone. So, that's where you are."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I'm a business guy. And I know this stuff. Now, let me just do this. Let me just tell you this. I truly believe that any cuts that are out there that somebody can bring me that's not going to just stifle us as a patient, I'm for. I am delivering to you $30 million worth of cuts. It won't hardly move the needle. I am telling you our decisions are not tough decisions. They're catastrophic decisions."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I really want you to pay close attention, because I truly from the bottom of my heart hate tax increases. Hate them. I really do. But I want to show you the most painless way that I think you can get out of this mess."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now I'm going to come around here and write. Here's what you gotta do. You gotta cut all that we can possibly cut. I've got to have everybody in this state pay a half of a penny in additional sales tax. There is no way around it. I've got to have you pay instead of $30 in DMV fees, I've got to have you pay 50."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"The other thing is this, in trying to be fair, in trying to just be fair. The people are here. Here is your people. Here's your people. Here's your businesses. I've got to have our businesses -- there's lots of different ways to look at this -- pay two-tenths of one percent in a tax that would be equivalent to a B&O tax. It is a tax that Ohio charges 25 percent -- or 25 hundredths. We would charge 20. And the other last thing I will talk to you about is I've got to have ten cents a gallon on gasoline. Now, I am telling you: If you don't do this, you're dead. You're dead beyond belief."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me go back over here and come back -- well, before I go, I'm going to stay with you a second. On these two right here, this one and this one, I want to sunset them. Three years. I think if you do what I am trying to propose to you to do, you can get rid of this, and you can get rid of this in three years."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, this deals with your roads. And this does too. Now, let me tell you this. I said a minute ago, I am adamantly against raising your taxes. We have got to find a way to not completely kill the patient."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, look what happens. Three years, this goes away. Three years, this goes away. I'll tell you about this in just one second."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I want to tell you one last thing. My goal -- Jim Justice's goal as your Governor -- is to do one thing, and that is to be the eighth state in this country with no income tax. None. Now, that's my goal. I hate like crazy to deliver to you what you have to do. That's my goal."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, remember, I said what I said about a half a penny. What would you rather do? Would you rather have your school plummeted even more. Your seniors just for gotten. Your vets forgotten. Your parks closed. Fairmont State shut down. On and on and on. Or would you be willing as a peoples to say: I'm willing to pay a half penny more. And I'm willing as a business to step up and pay two-tents of one percent. Because I love West Virginia. And we're going somewhere."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, listen here. If you pay -- if you way ten cents more for gasoline, and a little bit more on your DMV fees, that's going to turn into this. Here's what it's going to do. It will turn into $2.8 billion."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, just stay with me. I have four wonderful people back here. And I want you to understand wholeheartedly what your ten cents and almost nothing in DMV fees -- that haven't been raised in 40 years -- Think about it. Almost nothing. I am asking you to do, to turn into that. And then let me show you what we can do.  Y'all bring this on down."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, with us tonight is Kevin Coll, Andy Estep, Brooke Rumbaugh, and Cody Webb. Brooke and Cody are students studying engineering at Marshall and WVU. And Andy and Kevin already work with us in Highways."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"If you'll do this. You see those jobs. You see 'em? We can let every single road job that is on the books for one to three, and three to five years, tomorrow. We can let them all tomorrow. Think what this would do. Just imagine what it will do. I'll tell you what it will do. It will create 48,000 jobs in our state. 48,000 jobs. It will complete the network that we have got to do. It will make you tourism explode in this state. Honest to Pete. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Not me."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, there's two other things I want to do. And I'm going to sit because I'm sweating too much. I want to bid every one of these road jobs specifically labor intensive. And you know what I want to do from that? I want it to be our training ground. I want it to be our apprenticeship program. I want it to be something that will absolutely put our displaced miners that find a job here, or our young people that learn how to do something here. That's an opportunity."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you what else I want to do. For all the successful bidders, I want to charge them a 5 percent construction severance, whatever tax that may be, whatever you want to call it, to the successful bidder only. And my bet is, people, like me in business, will sharpen your pencils like crazy and it won't cost us 5 percent. It may cost us one. And then you know what I want to do? I want to pool that money. That money right there is $2.4 billion. If I could let every job tomorrow, it would amount to $120 million of a 5 percent pool that I would have."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"And then you know what I want to do with it? I want to fix the drug problem. If we don't fix the drug problem in this state, it will cannibalize you. We have to have stiffer laws. There's no question whatsoever, a drug pusher that rolls in here -- You guys can roll.-- a drug pusher that rolls in here from Detroit and selling drugs, he ought to know that this is not going to be a fun program if we catch him. We absolutely have to have a pathway to get our people that are hooked on these terrible drugs back into the community of the workforce. We have to do something with all the prescription drugs. No question whatsoever about that. But we have to have treatment facilities too."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I would propose today if we do this, and those dollars flow, I would propose immediately building a facility in Charleston, one in the Eastern Panhandle, and I know the veterans are waiting on the dollars to come from the fireworks tax and everything to build their facility in Beckley. And I would like to skim off some of this money to help them be able to get that facility built."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Let me go to education. Guys, I'm a coach. I'm in the school all the time. We've proven how to be dead last. If you had gone around me and had these round table discussions and listened -- just listened. You see, that's what I did. And I just listened. You got a bunch of really, really sad unhappy campers. So I think we need gigantic education reform."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Here's what I would do. I would submit a bill, and I will immediately, to eliminate any of the unnecessary bureaucracies that we have. We have got to return education back as much as we possibly can to a local level. I have put in my budget a 2 percent raise for all classroom teachers, and I am ashamed -- I'm ashamed that we can't do more."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, as far as testing, we are testing our kids t-totally to death. For what? I mean, here's the bottom line. Think about it. If we were knocking it out of the park -- you see, I'm all results oriented. If we were knocking it out of the park, you could argue with me we're doing the right thing. But for crying out loud, we're dead last. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out. We got to be doing something wrong. That's all there is to it. As far as the testing goes, I am going to propose we throw Smarter Balance in the trash can and we go to ACT testing."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,Let me show you this. Think about A through F for our schools. We do it on a bell curve. Think about this. Who in the world comes up with this stuff? These get an A. These get an F. All the big meat and potatoes get a C. And we call out to the world and say: Come to West Virginia. Our schools are mostly all C's. I don't get it. That's got to go. A through F is gone.
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, there is a beautiful lady here somewhere. Her name is Toni Poling. She's our Teacher of the Year. If she would stand. She teaches at Fairmont Senior."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, also, wherever they are, the beautiful lady Leah Curry, who is the West Virginia President of Toyota; and the gentleman, Jim Fawcett of Highmark is here somewhere, that made all that possible as well. Thank you."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Let me tell you. I said throughout the campaign, I said, education can be a revenue producer for us, and everybody looks at me: How in the world? There's no way. There's no way."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Everybody wants to go where your kids are going to be educated the best. Businesses want to go where your kids are going to be educated the best. We've got good teachers. We've got low crime. We've got good people. For crying out loud, we handcuff them every way coming and going. We got to stop that. And listen here. Maybe it's a twist of words on revenue producers, but if we could create an education mecca in West Virginia, honest to Pete, people would come and you couldn't beat them away. It would be a revenue producer."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I have to say: Jim Justice is no fan of consolidation. Again, I'll just tell you this. And I'll ask you: Are we this bad? Are we this desperate? You know, tell you what we could do. We could close every school in the state to save us some money, except we could have one. And we could have just one somewhere close to Charleston. And we'll bus every kid four hours, no more than four hours one way."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We're not that bad. We just have to have ideas. And we've got to have hope. Now, I truly mean this. One of the flood ravaged towns that I truly believe is coming back, and I can see it just like I can see it tomorrow: I hope and pray that we end up with a school in Richwood."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you this. Our veterans are phenomenally important. They've given everything to us, haven't they? Everything. Do we really take care of them? I mean, for crying out loud, we can't even maintain their cemetery. We've got to do better. We have to do better."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I'll be asking the Legislature to approve the increasing of our GARVEE capacity. And this one -- before you go, ""Oh, no,"" I want you to listen. I'll be asking the Legislature to raise our tolls on the turnpike a dollar."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, before you go crazy shooting at me, let me just say this. I want -- I want, through your DMV fees, I want to charge everybody within our state eight bucks. Eight dollars. Then I want you to drive on the turnpike or whatever road that we would choose to toll for free. So I want you to pay eight bucks, and I want you to drive on our turnpike, wherever it may be, for free. Or whatever road we toll for free. You see, 77 percent of our money is coming from out of state. If we could raise it and make yours as West Virginians free, other than eight bucks -- now you may live in the Eastern Panhandle and I would say to you: We need you to come and visit Princeton some point in time."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, if you come, for your eight bucks, we're going to give you a 50 percent discount on the tolls. Because you're going to pay nothing. And by the time you go through $3-$3-$3-$3-$3-$3 you're going to feel like you got a real bargain."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"And I'll tell you just this. Did you see all those highways? Did you see all that? Well, I will promise you there will be something that will be in your neighborhood that will be tolled as well. As we go forward there's going to have to be something in your neighborhood that will be tolled. And then the people from Princeton can come and visit you. And they can come for free too."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I truly believe that we ought to tier our severance tax on coal and gas. You know, it's just this simple. And our coal companies are really hurting. And I know a lot about this. When they're really hurting, we got to step up and help them. And at that point in time, we probably have to step up and lower the severance tax. The same way with the gas."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"But I am telling you, I am not a hog. I eat too much, but I'm not a hog. If we have the bonanza that I think is in front of us with coal -- especially metallurgical coals -- what if? What if I were to tell you, just this: Think about this for a second. If coal -- if coal is $35, whoever is mining that is losing money. Lowering the severance tax on that to 2 percent, or whatever you want to do, okay, I'm good. There's got to be a sweet spot to where we're back to five."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"What if it goes to $200 a ton? What happens? Two hundred dollars. I know this. There's no way that your cost -- anybody's cost -- is going to be greater than $80. At this level right here, anybody's profit is $120 a ton."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Listen. I'm a grain of sand in the coal business that I've been in. A grain of sand. And if we mine 2 million tons and we make this kind of money, we make $240 million in a year. We don't need to make that much money. At this point in time right here, this severance tax needs to be 10 percent. All it would do is lower the profitability to $110 a ton."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"All I'm saying is just this: Like it, or not like it, we have had our resources extracted from West Virginia over and over and over, and at the end of the rainbow, here we stand. We're $500 million upside-down. We can't have it keep going on. We can't be a third-world country. You can't do that."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, tourism. Tourism is so important to our state. We can knock it out of the park, back double triple. We probably need to reorganize the entire Tourism Department. There's ways to do that. And the other thing you just got to simply put more money in it. We better find a way to market ourselves. I said it a million times. I said it in the inaugural speech. For crying out loud, every time you turn the TV on it says: Come to Michigan. Every time. I said in the inaugural address, I said: Who in the world wants to go to Michigan? I mean, really? You know, what if I called up tomorrow and said, I tell you what let's do, let's get a bus and let's go to Detroit. But do we market us? We don't. We don't. We got to do that."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you -- and I'll be quick, because I know you're tired of listening to me. Coal has been so vital to us. It's been unbelievable. We should never forget who brung us to the dance. We should try with all our soul, with all in us, to try to help get our miners back to work."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"There are other things. Natural gas just fell out of the sky on us, didn't it? We need to do everything we can to exploit that to make it even better and better and better and better. You know, there's issues within natural gas. I think it's called joint development, or lease integration, that they really want. And I can't possibly within me see: Why not? What's wrong with that? Why not?"
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, we can help that industry. Listen to me on this. There are other things. I will be submitting with Senator Capito and Senator Manchin immediately -- and I think that there's a real shot -- I will be submitting whatever the form of a bill may be to some way, somehow, try to drive furniture manufacturing, flooring manufacturing, cabinetry, back right in our lap to West Virginia."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"It can truly be done. We've got to do it through an environmental subsidy. That's what has to be done. You see I'm the agronomy end of our agriculture stuff. I know about trees. I know about how they eat all the carbon. And I know how when we take a piece of wood like this to a dry kiln, the carbon is right here. And I know when the tree falls on the ground and eventually the carbon will be released back in the sky, especially if you have a fire. And I know we only cut one-third of our growth in West Virginia."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We are the perfect candidate for what President Trump wants to do in bringing manufacturing back to the United States, that today -- today all of our furniture manufacturing is in Vietnam, China and Mexico. I love Vietnam China and Mexico. From a distance. I want stuff for us."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I got to say this about President Trump. Many of you would wonder, but I am really good friends with the Trump family. And I truly believe that Donald Trump will do all he possibly can as our president to help West Virginians. He will. He's called me all kinds of times, and his son Eric has called all kinds of times, and now Don is probably going come and want to come and go turkey hunting with me."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Not Donald. Because Donald is not a turkey hunter. But let me tell you. He truly -- he truly, really identified with our miners. And he understands the blight. And he's a friend. If we give him a chance, he'll really try to help us."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, as we're winding down here, I would say there are certain things within government consolidation that we can do. There's no question. I get it, I get it, I get it. We need to watch every penny to try to save every dollar, on and on and on. I mean, I've already started this. And for crying out loud, I drive my own vehicle. We eliminated all the vehicles in my little world. You know, we're going to try to get rid of some of the state's aircraft. We're absolutely -- Right now, we've identified 207 vehicles that we can basically get rid of. And what I want to do is line them up in front of the Capitol and have an auction and get rid of them."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We can't forget agriculture. Agriculture -- let me tell you. Furniture manufacturing. It can help us. It may be two years away. Agriculture can help us. It may be two years away. That's why I said a little while ago, that 800-pound gorilla is setting right in your face right now."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"When I bond that together, the gas tax and the DMV fees, I've got to go to a vote. A vote of the people. I've got to have 90 days after you approve it to go to a vote. I am begging the people to call you and drive you crazy to get to that vote. Because we have to do that. We've got to do that and do that right now."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, and I believe -- and I will do this immediately, I will employ some person -- gosh, I can't imagine being called this, a Waste Czar. But I'll have him absolutely dig into every agency known to man and try to find any excess monies that have been shoved away and hidden. And I'll have him look. And I'll have him try to find."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me just give you my philosophy of our regulatory agencies. My philosophy is just this. You know, I've had the great gift to be able to hire so many good people. Our cabinet choices and the people we've surrounded ourselves with, we didn't care if they were republicans or democrats, independents. They're real good. They're really good. I told the people at the DMV, I told Austin Caperton -- Austin said to me, he said: What do you really want to see happen? The list could be a mile long, couldn't it. A lot of people would say to Jim Justice: Jim, write a job description of what you do."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Well, I could write and write and write, couldn't I? But the bottom line is just this. The right person for the right job and they're motivated. That's what Jim Justice does. Right person, right job, and they're motivated."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I told Austin Caperton, I said, Austin, we have people coming from everywhere with any kind of business request under the sun. A lot of times our inspectors show up, and they show up -- and I hate to say this, because you're going to probably think, boy, has he really lost it now, but they show up with a T-shirt on and a pair of old jeans. They maybe haven't shaved forever. And they got a badge in their pocket. "
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, listen, I think they ought to look like something. And the other thing -- and they will look like something, or we'll have them tending to Grisly Adams. But the other thing is just this. No matter what the request may be, I think that the first words out of their mouths should be: We're going to try with all in us to do what you want to do."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, did you understand what I said? What I said is just this. So many times our regulatory agencies absolutely, no matter what on earth we try to do, they're there to tell you no. They're not there to tell us no."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I underline -- underline, underline, underline -- nobody loves the outdoors as much as me.  Nobody loves water as much as me. We're not going to break the law. We're got going to do anything to damage the environment to the very best of our abilities. Or our waters. But we are not going to just say no."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me end -- and you're saying thank God -- let me end by just saying this. Please, not only you, all the viewers that are out there, listen to me. This situation is beyond dire. These people are trying. I've had the great opportunity to meet with Mitch and Tim and others, and all kinds of -- Roman and the other Tim, and on and on and on. Good people. They're good. They're good people. And they want to try to help, just like I want to try to help. But I am telling you to the best that Jim Justice could possibly tell you, you elected me to try to get us out of Ricky Mokel's hole. That's what you elected me to do. New ideas. Aggressive ideas. Bold ideas."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"We're dying. We are dying. It is so bloomin' bad, you can't possibly imagine it. Now, there's a way out. There's real prosperity in front of us. There's a way out."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"I would tell you, a long, long time ago, Frankenstein, he used to walk through the streets like ""boom, boom,"" and I always thought, if you got caught by Frankenstein, you deserve to die."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I would tell you just this. If we don't do anything, and all we do is kick the can down the road, and all we do is fight, then we deserve to die."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,I really believe there's a rocket ship ride right at our fingerprints. A ride like you cannot possibly imagine. I would say to you: Let's don't just try to figure out how to just get by. Let's cannonball right in the middle of the pool. We can do this. We absolutely can do it.
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, I would say to the outside world: Call all your legislators. Call all your in-laws and your outlaws and your neighbors. Call them all. This is a pathway. I've given you a real pathway. And I hope that you'll seriously consider it."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, it was folksy. It was just plain talk. That's all I know. We have an incredible, incredible obligation and an unbelievable opportunity. Now I would say with all these great people, all of you, together, with this great body, you can have my heart and soul. I will work with you with every ounce of being that I have. Together, this great body and myself -- and this isn't a very great body -- but all of us will get there."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Now, let me tell you just this and then I'll end. My basketball teams, a lot of times they say two words coming out on the floor. And they scream them.  And do you know the other night Tom Brady led a comeback that was unbelievable, didn't he? Unbelievable. No one could have possibly imagined it. And you know what he did? He took the Super Bowl trophy -- I watched him do this -- he stood on that podium and he screamed, ""Let's go!"" After he had won."
West Virginia,Jim Justice,Republican,"Well, I'd say to you: Let's go! God bless you all. Thank you."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Honorable Supreme Court Justices, tribal nation leaders, Constitutional Officers, Major General Dunbar and the members of the Wisconsin National Guard as well as active and retired members of our armed forces, Senate President Roth, Majority Leader Fitzgerald, Minority Leader Shilling, Speaker Vos, and Minority Leader Hintz, cabinet members, legislators, distinguished guests, and, most importantly, people of Wisconsin: welcome, and thank you for being here."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Before we get started, I also want to recognize someone else who’s here with us tonight. He’s a Wisconsin institution and embodies both the soul of our campus and the spirit of our state, marching band director and director of bands at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dr. Mike Leckrone."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"This year marks The Professor’s 50th and final year leading UW’s marching band as he will be retiring at the end of this year. He’s directed halftime shows for nearly half of Camp Randall’s existence and has seen coaches and chancellors and band members come and go. But even more than the “stop at the top” or the 5th Quarter post-game routines, The Professor will be remembered for what a remarkable leader, teacher, and inspirer he’s been, not just for his students, but for people across our state. So, tonight, we honor The Professor and thank him for his service."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"I’d also like to introduce my former junior prom date, Kathy, who’s up there in the gallery tonight. My daughter, Katie, is also here tonight, and my other kids are I’m sure watching from home with my grandkids who are going to be up way past their bedtime. Thank you for supporting me—I love you all."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"I’m Tony Evers, and I’m incredibly honored to be here tonight as the 46th governor of the great state of Wisconsin to say the state of our state is that we’ve got work to do, and we’re ready for bipartisan solutions."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"You know, a few weeks ago, I stood just outside of here where I took the oath of office and delivered my inaugural address. And I remind you today, just as I did weeks ago, of the spirit of our service, of the power that we have, and the responsibility that we bear."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"We are a state forged by the Wisconsin Idea--the notion that education informs our public policy and that knowledge should embrace the communities we're called to serve. But today, we are also a state among the worst to raise a black family, and we are a state that’s spending more on corrections than our entire UW System."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"We are a state that once cultivated new technology--from typewriters to automobiles, we’ve led the nation in innovation. But today, we are a state that’s behind on broadband expansion, and we trail the country in start-ups and small business creation."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"We are a state that was the birthplace of BadgerCare, and we’ve been a laboratory for democracy. But today, we are also a state where it’s become cheaper to get healthcare by driving across the Mississippi River."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The realities we face are bigger than me or any political party. The magnitude of our challenges requires us to put people first because, as I’ve said, that is the promise of our service."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"So, tonight, I’m asking you to join me in making good on that promise by moving forward, together."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Fixing our economy remains a priority. That’s why just last week I directed the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to create an innovation and entrepreneurship committee focusing on supporting our small businesses, seeding capital funds, and technology development."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,But there is more to an economy than counting job creation. And the state of our state is more than just our unemployment rate.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The opportunity we have to offer is not just the number of jobs we create; it’s counted, too, by the number of workers who will work forty hours each week and still won’t make enough to keep their family out of poverty."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The strength of our success is not found solely in fiscal surplus; it’s defined, too, by the number of our kids who will go to school hungry tomorrow."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The metric for our posterity is not just what we keep in the coffers for a rainy day; it’s measured, too, by the quality of the natural resources we’re leaving behind for our kids and their kids after them."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The state of our state is the work of Lisa, who is also in the gallery tonight. Lisa is the Founder and President of the Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness. The Foundation serves more than 1,000 women and girls working to eliminate health disparities affecting Black women, their families, and their communities. Thank you, Lisa!"
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The state of our state is also the story of Jen, who grew up in Cashton. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Jen has access to comprehensive, patient-centered care that is tailored to her needs. Being able to afford services and insurance has allowed Jen to take control of her health from preventative to reproductive to behavioral healthcare. Jen is also here in the gallery tonight. Thanks, Jen!"
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The state of our state is the story of Jose who came to Abbotsford, Wisconsin, from Mexico with his parents when he was twelve years old. Jose learned English through Abbotsford’s English as a second language program and gained a sense of community when he signed up to play baseball in high school. Jose decided to stay here in Wisconsin. He still lives in Abbotsford where he’s raising his sons, Marco and Nickolas, and coaches their baseball team, the Broncos. And he’s become a naturalized citizen. Jose and his son Marco are up in the gallery tonight. Thanks for being here, Jose and Marco."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The state of our state is the story of students like Alex from Boyceville Middle School. Alex’s teacher describes her as having the drive and passion that make her excited to come to work every day. Alex has worked hard to turn things around at school and is now passing all of her classes, has no missed assignments, and has gone above and beyond to help other students, too. And it’s also the story of students like Diamond from Parker High School in Janesville where the school nurse describes her as the strongest young lady she has the pleasure of knowing. Diamond’s family has had some tough times, but Diamond has persevered, is excelling in school, and has dreams of becoming a pediatrician or pediatric nurse. Diamond is here in the gallery and tonight I’m excited to announce Alex and Diamond are the first-ever recipients of the Star Student Award in Wisconsin."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"When I stood before you just a few weeks ago to deliver my inaugural address, I said it was time to get to work. And we have."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,But the real work—the hardest work—is yet to be done.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Last month, Mandela and I traveled across the state listening to Wisconsinites talk about their values and their vision for our future. We talked about policies and solutions that connect the dots."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,And I keep saying that--connecting the dots--and I’ve been asked several times what I mean by that--it’s about seeing a forest through the trees.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,It’s about seeing the connection between how lack of access to affordable housing affects kids in the classroom. It’s about seeing the connection between drug and alcohol addiction and our burgeoning criminal justice system. It’s about seeing the connection between a budding entrepreneur who wants to start their own business and how the rising costs of health insurance might push that dream out of reach.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"The budget that I’ll be introducing in the coming weeks is about connecting those dots. And to no one’s surprise, it begins—as it always has for me—with education."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,Connecting the dots means recognizing that what’s best for our kids is best for our state. The investment we make in our kids today will yield dividends for generations. That’s why our budget reaffirms our state’s commitment to our kids by returning to two-thirds funding for schools across Wisconsin.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"I was pleased to learn that the Speaker has encouraged his members to support this provision in our budget, and I hope that I can count on your support going forward."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"In addition to two-thirds funding, we’re also going to make sure that we have resources to support our kids with special needs. For the past decade, we’ve not only cut funding for public schools, we've failed to fully fund services for special education. This has forced local school districts and taxpayers to squeeze resources from other areas to provide these critical services. Our budget will provide an unprecedented $600 million-dollar increase in special education funding. That means our school districts will have enough to allocate the resources they do have to other areas of high need."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"And we’re not just going to increase support for our kids with special needs. We’re going to get to work on closing the achievement gap for low-income students and students of color. Our state’s achievement gap is among the highest in the nation in reading and math scores. As State Superintendent, I submitted proposals that would’ve helped address our state’s achievement gap. Unfortunately, most of these proposals never made it through the Legislative process. I believe this is the year they will. And my Urban Initiatives programs will also empower minority students in our state’s highest-need districts by expanding early childhood education and summer school grant programs."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"It is urgent that we increase support for our low-income students and students of color. The longer we wait to invest in closing our achievement gap, the wider the gap will get, and the more it will cost us in the long-run."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Finally, we’re going to propose a five-fold increase in mental health programs for K-12 students across our state. But funding mental health programming in our schools is not enough; so tonight, we renew our commitment to making sure everybody has access to quality, affordable healthcare."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,We’ve already started working to make sure healthcare in Wisconsin is affordable and accessible. We signed executive orders creating a Healthy Communities Initiative and calling upon the Department of Health Services to prioritize these goals. We also called upon our state agencies to connect the dots and work together on how we can protect healthcare coverage for people in our state.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"But our work can’t stop there. That’s why our budget will also seek to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, this will enable an additional 76,000 Wisconsinites to have access to affordable healthcare. This would also save Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, allowing us to reallocate those cost savings to other critical programs."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"We have a real opportunity here, folks. At the end of the day, Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Speaker, healthcare should not be a partisan issue--Republican states like Kentucky, Nebraska, and Idaho have expanded Medicaid, and so have Democratic states like Washington, California, and Minnesota. We should be able to get it done here, too."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,The people of Wisconsin voted for a change this November and asked us to stop playing politics with their health care. That’s why I’m announcing tonight that I have fulfilled a promise I made to the people of Wisconsin by directing Attorney General Kaul to withdraw from a lawsuit that would gut coverage for the 2.4 million Wisconsinites who have pre-existing conditions. I’ve said all along that I believe the best way to maintain protections for healthcare here in Wisconsin is to stop trying to dismantle those protections at the federal level.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"In addition, we’re also going to address Wisconsin’s transportation funding crisis."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,I appointed Secretary-designee Craig Thompson because I know that he will work on both sides of the aisle for a solution that works for Wisconsin. I fully expect that he will be approved with consent of the Senate.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"I’ve said all along that I believe we have to bring people together to work on this issue, and I believe Secretary-designee Thompson can get it done. In the coming days, we’ll be announcing a task force of stakeholders to get to work on proposing a bipartisan policy solution to be included in The People’s Budget. The task force will solicit feedback from key partners from all regions of the state, all sectors of the economy, and users of all different modes of transportation."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"And while I know that caucus members in both houses support different approaches to solving our transportation funding crisis, it’s going to take sacrifices and compromises to find a long-term, comprehensive solution that works for everyone."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,But roads and bridges are only a small part of the infrastructure challenges facing our state. That’s why I’m also declaring 2019 is the Year of Clean Drinking Water in Wisconsin.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"According to the Department of Health Services, 1.7 million Wisconsinites depend on private wells for water, and 47% of these wells do not meet acceptable health standards. Meanwhile, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we have an estimated 176,000 lead service lines across our state. Removing lead service lines could cost over $2 billion. But Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that for every $1 we spend on replacing lead drinking water lines, we will see a 133% return on our investment in higher lifetime earnings and better health outcomes."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"That’s why, in the coming weeks, I’ll be signing an executive order to designate a person at the Department of Health Services to take charge on addressing Wisconsin’s lead crisis and to help secure federal funding for prevention and treatment programs."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Finally, we’re going to cut taxes by ten percent for everyone making up to $100,000 and families making up to $150,000. But we’re not going to do it by spending money we don’t have or that might not be there in two years. I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I’m not going to propose things that we can’t pay for. So instead, we’re going to fund tax relief for hard-working families by capping a corporate tax credit, 80% of which goes to filers making more than $1 million a year."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"An economy that works for all of us, healthier communities, more money for our kids and our schools, better roads and infrastructure--that is what the people of Wisconsin expect from us, and that is what the people of Wisconsin deserve."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Given the challenges we face, I expect the Legislature will focus on these important priorities instead of being distracted by division and preventing us from working together to get things done."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"You know, in the Governor’s conference room inscribed on the ceiling is a phrase that reads, “The will of the people is the law of the land.”"
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,The will of the people is the law of the land.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,That means I expect legislation arriving on my desk will be passed with broad support and in the spirit of bipartisanship.
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"That means instead of taking up an entirely new budget of its own, I expect the Legislature to take up the budget I crafted by and with the people of our state."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"I’ll tell you today as I told you a few weeks ago that I have never been more hopeful about our state and our kids’ future. I have no doubt that there will be issues on which we disagree. I have no doubt that there will be times when we will be frustrated by the deliberative process of democracy. But we will engage civilly. We will have discourse and dialogue, but it will not devolve into disrespect. And we will govern with a humble appreciation that the will of the people--our people--is the law of the land."
Wisconsin,Tony Evers,Democrat,"Now, let’s get back to work. Thank you, and On, Wisconsin!"
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"President Foley, Speaker Scheer, Members of the Legislature, Tribal Chairmen, Distinguished Guests, Friends, Fellow Nebraskans, and of course, our First Lady, my lovely wife Susanne—good morning!"
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Before I begin, I want to recognize your newest member, Senator Theresa Thibodeau of Omaha.  She is a small business owner and involved with early childhood education.  Her background and experience will be a great contribution to the body.  I look forward to working with you, Senator."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"To all the senators, congratulations on the commencement of the second session of the 105th Nebraska Legislature."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Working together is in our DNA, and is the hallmark of Nebraska’s non-partisan, Unicameral Legislature.  In fact, leadership and working together helped build this great state.  We know this from our history."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.  During World War I, Nebraskans came together to raise private dollars to form a field hospital for wounded soldiers returning from the Front.  Many gravely injured were treated at the “Little Nebraska” hospital."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"That spirit is alive and well today.  When Hurricanes Harvey and Irma battered our coast from Florida to Texas, Nebraska National Guard members answered the call and came to the aid of families and communities in need."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Nebraska National Guard members not only serve their fellow citizens, but are on the front line in the War on Terror.  Last month, I visited 54 of our National Guard soldiers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba who are helping to detain enemy combatants.  Twenty-five years ago new enlistees did not expect to be deployed overseas.  Today, men and women who join the National Guard not only expect to be deployed, but want to take the fight to the enemy.  I am incredibly proud of them, and we salute them for their service and sacrifice."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Nebraskans have a long tradition of pulling together to help each other in good times and bad.  We’ve built our stories right into our Capitol building as a source of inspiration.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In the spirit of cooperation, we come together each year to accomplish the priorities that matter most to Nebraskans."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Our work together is helping to grow our state and keep Nebraska the best place in the world to live, work, and raise a family."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"It is not always easy, but it is important.  Working together last year, we accomplished many great things. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Under Speaker Scheer’s leadership, you passed a bill that protects the ability of our teachers to exercise religious freedom."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"With Chairman Stinner’s help, we worked on and enacted an unprecedented two budgets, so that the state can live within its means. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Senator Watermeier delivered to my desk the first pro-life legislation in several years with the “Choose Life” license plate.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Senator Friesen and Senator Murante worked with us to streamline state government and merge state agencies.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Senators Riepe, Blood, Erdman, Lowe, and Lindstrom led successful efforts to reform occupational licenses."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Senator Walz successfully championed a bill protecting injured first responders from losing their healthcare insurance.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Senator Hilgers and Senator Geist passed legislation which allows our Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for environmental reviews.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Senator Kuehn helped end the practice of allowing people to quit their jobs and turn around and claim unemployment benefits.  Nebraska was one of the last states to make this change!
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,And Senator Wishart had a common sense bill which I signed that allows counties to protect the personal information of law enforcement officers.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Those accomplishments were not always easy—but through leadership and working together we got the job done.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,This is my fourth State of the State address and our fourth year of working together on the priorities Nebraskans care about.  And I’m happy to report that the state of the state is strong and growing!
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Last year, Nebraska won the Governor’s Cup for most economic development projects per capita of any state in the country.  Nebraska had more qualified projects than North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas combined."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Forbes ranks Nebraska the fourth best state for business.  We moved up seven spots in Chief Executive Magazine’s ranking of best states for business. 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Folks, this matters because when companies move here and invest, they create job opportunities for our people."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"This past year, we’ve continued to achieve record levels of employment with over 1 million non-farm jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in our state since 1999 at 2.7 percent.  And our population hit 1.92 million people for the first time ever."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,These achievements are no coincidence.  Senators in this chamber and the teammates in my administration work every day to grow Nebraska.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Working with you, we will continue to bring new opportunities to Nebraska.  International partnerships are helping us create great-paying job opportunities for Nebraskans. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"For example, we went to Canada in August to help recruit Agri-Plastics, which has created 20 new jobs in Sidney."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,A new investment from Novozymes in Blair followed our 2015 visit to Denmark.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Japan is Nebraska’s number one foreign direct investor.  There’s no better example of that than Kawasaki, which just opened their first U.S. aerospace division right here in Lincoln.  Our trade mission in 2015 supported this expanded investment. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"When we foster more investment by multinational businesses, we help Nebraskans like Eric Jones.  Eric’s been a long-time production worker for Kawasaki, and he’s a great teammate who gets paid a good wage to support his wife and three children.  When Kawasaki announced the aerospace expansion, he volunteered and he earned a spot as a supervisor.  The company flew him to Japan for three months of training."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Eric told me Kawasaki is great for Lincoln.  Besides the good-paying jobs and investment, Kawasaki supports local charities and uses local vendors.  Eric and his wife Miranda are here with us today.  Let’s give them a warm welcome and thanks! "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In Nebraska, we export over $8 billion of goods annually. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Our work in China over the last three years helped open the door for Nebraska beef for the first time in 14 years.  Beef from a Nebraska company was the first to arrive in China last summer, and I’m excited to report that over half the American beef in China now comes from Nebraska!"
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In the past 12 months, we have also seen Argentina reopen their market to American pork.  Bulgaria signed new soybean deals with Nebraska.  Vietnam opened their doors to dried distillers grains.  And Japan is set to open their marketplace to American ethanol."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,These successes wouldn’t be possible without the great international teams at the Department of Agriculture and Department of Economic Development.  Our teams are working together to grow market access and develop new partnerships.  They are with us here today.  Please help me thank them for their great work! 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We also work hard to recruit U.S.-based businesses.  The Silicon Prairie has continued to thrive.  In 2016, my team and I traveled to Menlo Park, California to sell Facebook on Nebraska.  Last year, Facebook broke ground on a 970,000 square foot campus in Papillion, which will create hundreds of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Costco selected Fremont as the home for their first-ever chicken processing operation.  A team effort closed the deal with the help of state agencies, business leaders, and elected officials."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Other major investments have come from companies such as Hudl, Becton Dickinson, Cargill, Evonik and our ethanol producers.  These are just a few of the over 200 projects that state, regional, and local economic developers worked on in our efforts to grow Nebraska last year."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"These investments in Nebraska help Eric Jones, his family, and so many other families to have an opportunity to work hard and invest in their communities."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We can recruit business because we have a great story to tell here in Nebraska.  Throughout the year, our team works every day to make government run at the speed of business by making it more effective, more efficient, and more customer-focused."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Our Center of Operational Excellence is working with state agencies to eliminate waste and speed up service.  With this philosophy, we are turning around environmental permits in a single day, reducing backlogs for tax credit applications, and more."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We are also delivering licenses faster, so we can connect medical professionals to great job opportunities here in our state.  For example, we reduced the nurse licensing processing time from 96 days in November 2015 to an average of just 30 days in December 2017."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Changes like this are helping Nebraska put people to work more quickly.  Shalah Shannon recently moved to Bellevue with her husband who is in the Air Force.  She applied for her nurse license in December and received it in 15 days.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,This is just one of many great stories about how we are improving our services.  Running an operationally excellent organization is a team effort.  Please help me recognize the Center of Operational Excellence team for all their great work.  They are here today. 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"To complement the work we are doing in the area of process improvement, my agencies are also cutting red tape.  In July, we launched a review aimed at cutting unnecessary regulation to streamline state government. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In November, state agencies came back with initial recommendations.  Today, Senator Murante is introducing legislation at my request which will help eliminate unnecessary red tape.  Thank you, Senator Murante!"
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,All of this great work we’ve done together sets a tone that Nebraska is open for business from manufacturing to technology to agriculture.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,But we also have challenges.  The first of which is working on the budget.  This is our top priority.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In October, the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board reduced the revenue forecast.  While our state’s economy once again has the wind at its back, revenues continue to fall short of the board’s expectations. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We’ve been preparing for this.  We’ve reduced our state workforce by 500, or about 4 percent, and eliminated 1,500 open positions.  In preparation for budget cuts, we reduced agency allotments by 2 percent over the final two quarters of the year. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Last year, working with you, we balanced the budget without raising taxes.  This year, we need to do the same again."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,I am proposing across-the-board reductions of 2 percent in this fiscal year and 4 percent in the next year.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Consistent with our work, I have designated priorities for funding in the budget like K-12 education, Corrections, and services to help the developmentally disabled."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,I am also asking you to make new targeted investments.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We have seen a significant increase in the number of children coming into our state’s child welfare system.  Annually, we are up about 9 percent, or about 485 kids.  That is heartbreaking."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"In this budget, I am recommending an additional $35 million to Child Welfare and Public Assistance for this year and next.  We must take care of our kids."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"DHHS reports that in the first seven months of 2017, parents using methamphetamine were a factor in one of every three removals of children from their homes.  We have to get to the bottom of this disturbing trend and all of the other contributing factors.  That’s why I will be forming a new child welfare task force to determine the root causes."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,We also must continue to invest in Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services.  I am recommending expanding the number of corrections officers as well as reinvesting $6 million in unspent funds back into our prisons.  This will help us expand our capacity. 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Additionally, thanks to action by Congress, my budget recommends new steps to protect unborn life by ensuring that federal Title X dollars are not used to fund abortion.  Nebraska is a pro-life state, and our budget should reflect those values."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,I look forward to working with Chairman Stinner and the entire Appropriations Committee to balance the budget.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Our next challenge has to do with taxes.  Cutting and reforming taxes is key to growing Nebraska.  Over the years, together, we have done the hard work needed to hold the line on taxes, but Nebraskans need and expect more. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"If we are going to remain competitive and grow into the future, we must continue our efforts—no matter how difficult.  The Tax Foundation ranks Nebraska’s property taxes as 11th highest in the nation, which is the worst among surrounding states. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"While we have provided over $840 million in property tax relief over four years, we’ve all heard stories of how high property taxes are hurting Nebraskans.  This fall, a farmer approached me at an event to let me know that his high property taxes had driven him to sell his farm, leave Nebraska, and move to Missouri.  That’s terrible.  Stories like this have inspired me to continue making property tax relief a top priority. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,It’s an urgent need.  We must help our farmers and ranchers with crushing property tax bills.  We must help all Nebraskans keep more of their hard-earned money and attract more people to come to our state.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Our neighboring states are making themselves more competitive.  The only surrounding state with an income tax higher than ours is Iowa, and right now Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and their Legislature are lowering their taxes.  Missouri just lowered their tax rates this month."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,My team has been working tirelessly with you and a wide variety of groups throughout the summer and fall.  We have to show our taxpayers that we get the message.  They want tax relief.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"That’s why today, Senator Smith is introducing the Nebraska Property Tax Cuts and Opportunity Act.  This legislation will serve as the framework for delivering tax relief this session."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Our proposal has three major components. 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"First, it restructures existing property tax credits as a new refundable credit on state taxes, which ensures that Nebraskans—not absentee landowners—receive the credits.  It also provides for additional relief in future years when our revenue is growing.  Over the next 10 years, we expect this would provide over $4 billion in property tax relief for ag producers and home owners.  And it focuses the relief on the average Nebraska homeowner."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Second, in today’s mobile economy, young people graduating from our colleges, skilled workers, and even longtime residents can up and move to lower tax states.  We have the jobs and great communities.  Let’s also work towards an income tax system that is just as welcoming.  Our proposal uses existing tax credits to achieve a permanent reduction in the state’s uncompetitive individual and corporate income tax rates.  This will provide relief for our families and small businesses.  Right now, 90 percent of individual income taxes paid by Nebraskans are at that top individual rate, and 90 percent of Nebraska businesses pay at the top individual rate."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Finally, our proposal provides for an additional $10 million dollars over two years for workforce development. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Folks, we can bring relief to Nebraska’s families and businesses and help continue to grow our state.  It is critical that we get the job done on tax relief this session. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Senator Smith and I will continue to work with senators and other groups seeking tax relief.  We all need to be open to compromise.  Tax relief will need to be a bipartisan effort, and it will be something we all do together for the good of our entire state."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Let’s roll up our sleeves and get the job done.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"We have our work cut out for us, but I have no doubt we’re up to the challenge.  When we are here in the State Capitol, let’s do what’s right for the hardworking people of Nebraska like Eric and Miranda Jones."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"To make that happen, we have to remain laser-focused on growing Nebraska.  This session, that means: Cutting red tape, balancing the budget, and delivering tax relief."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,Nebraskans expect results. 
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"As demonstrated during time of war, in the midst of natural disaster, and on the walls of our State Capitol, the character of our people is to work together.  In doing so, we will continue to make Nebraska the best place in the world to live, work, and raise a family."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,It’s hard to believe that this will be the last session for several of our most experienced members who are term-limited or retiring.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,They have collectively made significant contributions to the state.
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Please join me in recognizing Senators Baker, Brasch, Harr, Krist, Larson, Schumacher, and Smith for their work over the last several years."
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"When the University of Nebraska named Scott Frost as the next head football coach, he offered a formula for winning that applies here: “a lot of good people that care about this place working really hard, it’s toughness, it’s dedication, it’s work ethic, and that’s what Nebraska is, that’s what the people of Nebraska are...”"
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"Those words are valuable to our service here in the Capitol.  As we turn the page and open the next chapter in our work, there will almost certainly be principled disagreements and heated debates. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"But for over 150 years, Nebraskans have always come together for a cause bigger than themselves.  We will draw upon their strength this year to address the priorities of our people. "
Wyoming,Mark Gordon,Republican,"God Bless you in your work, God Bless America, and God Bless the great State of Nebraska."
